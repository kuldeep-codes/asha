<p>A report in finance and operations apps can be defined simply as a structured presentation of data.
Under ideal circumstances, reports materialize data in such a way that it allows the user to make informed decisions.
Finance and operations apps supports a broad spectrum of information access scenarios that include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cross company all-up financial reporting</li>
<li>Analytical dashboards and tiles</li>
<li>Electronically-transferable funds</li>
<li>Customer sales invoices</li>
<li>Checks and tax documents</li>
</ul>
<p>In this module, you will learn about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different types of reports and inquiries in finance and operations apps</li>
<li>Financial reporting</li>
<li>Configuring finance and operations apps for Microsoft Power Platform</li>
</ul>

<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>The first step in working with the reporting functionality in finance and operations apps is to understand the reporting features that already exist and that you can use, either as they are, or through small extensions to match your customer requirements.</p>
<p>Finance and operations apps provide several reporting tools that cater to various data access scenarios.</p>
<p>For example, the needs of users when they are interacting with business documents differ greatly from scenarios where they want to explore data at an aggregate level or derive insights by using Artificial Intelligence models that are hosted in the cloud.</p>
<p>Finance and operations apps provide specialized tools for  reporting experiences:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Embedded analytics and native controls</strong> - Built-in visualizations that are used in operational reports to aggregate data to workspaces, by using native controls such as charts and grids.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)</strong> - Primarily used for business documents and high-volume printing scenarios that are common with invoices, packing slips, picking lists, and more.</p>
<p>Many pre-generated SSRS reports come out of the box with finance and operations apps. SSRS reports allow you to print reports to different locations, such as your screen, printer, a file, or an email. You can use SSRS reports to create parameterized views with drill-down navigation. You can also embed hyperlinks from a report to finance and operations apps pages.
Additionally, you can schedule your reports to run periodically by using a batch job. SSRS reports can also help you create precise compliance documents for your local regulatory business. In addition to the out-of-the-box reports, you can create and modify additional reports by using X++ development to suit your organization's needs.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Financial Report Designer</strong> - Flexible tool that is used to customize and create financial statements such as balance sheets, income statements, and cashflow statements.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Power Platform</strong> - Includes dashboards and workspaces that contain predefined and personalized views, Power BI, Power Apps, and Power Automate integrations.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Electronic reporting</strong> - Used to configure formats for incoming and outgoing electronic documents in accordance with the legal requirements of various countries or regions. Electronic Reporting lets you manage these formats during their lifecycle.
For example, you can adopt new regulatory requirements, and generate business documents in the required format to electronically exchange information with government bodies, banks, and other parties.</p>
<p>The Electronic reporting engine is targeted at business users instead of developers. Because you configure formats instead of code, the processes for creating and adjusting formats for electronic documents are faster and easier.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="microsoft-office-integrations">Microsoft Office integrations</h2>
<p>By using the Microsoft Office integration built-in feature, you can export selected, or all, rows from a list page grid and export data entity values into a Microsoft Excel workbook for reporting purposes. Then, you can use the rich capabilities of Excel, such as pivot table, charts, and more, to present your data.</p>
<div class="mx-imgBorder">
<p><a data-linktype="relative-path" href="media/grid-export.svg#lightbox"><img alt="Screenshot of the Export to Excel menu from the List page grid." data-linktype="relative-path" src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/work-analytics-reporting-finance-operations/media/grid-export.svg"/></a></p>
</div>
<p>Finance and operations uses the Excel Data Connector to view, update, and edit data within an Excel workbook. You will need to download the Microsoft Dynamics Add-in to use this feature. On some pages, you can select the <strong>Open in Office</strong> icon on the Action Pane.</p>
<p>From there, you can select <strong>Open in Excel</strong> or <strong>Export to Excel</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Open in Excel</strong> - Lets you use the data entity that is related to the form data. The columns that appear on your Excel workbook are defined in the <strong>AutoReport</strong> field group on the entity. You can also add or remove fields from the entity by using the <strong>Design</strong> button. Additionally, you can filter the data by using the <strong>Filter</strong> button. The <strong>Open in Excel</strong> feature also gives you the ability to change the data in the grid and publish the changes back to finance and operations apps.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Export to Excel</strong> - Exports all the grid data to an Excel workbook. When the data is in a workbook, you can use the tools in Excel to manipulate the data and create visual charts for your reporting needs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="financial-reporting">Financial reporting</h2>
<p>Standard financial reports are provided by using the default main account categories in finance and operations apps. Use the Report designer to create or modify traditional financial statements, such as the Income statement and Balance sheet, and share the results with other members of your organization.</p>
<div class="modular-content-container" hidden="" id="next-section">
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">Financial reporting</h2>
<div class="section is-uniform position-relative" id="unit-inner-section">
<h1 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">Financial reporting</h1>


<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>Financial reporting allows financial and business professionals to create, maintain, and view financial statements. It moves beyond traditional reporting constraints to help you efficiently design various types of reports.</p>
<p>Financial reporting includes dimension support to determine what financial dimensions you want to include, and the sequence, and enables the building of a custom reporting structure.</p>
<p>You can map the following to gain better insight of financial data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Main accounts</li>
<li>Financial dimensions</li>
<li>Combinations of the two</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, you can create financial row structures to focus on cost accounts. You can set up unlimited financial dimensions that allow for cost detail.
The following financial dimensions are examples that might be associated with cost accounts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost centers</li>
<li>Departments</li>
<li>Combinations of the two</li>
</ul>
<p>The Financial reporting database is deployed to its own SQL Azure database on the same SQL Azure service as the finance and operations apps instance. This means that the database is preconfigured when you deploy finance and operations apps, and automatically links to available databases so that the Financial report designer can connect to it.</p>
<h2 id="report-designer">Report designer</h2>
<p>By using Report designer, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Save and reuse dimension combinations for multiple reports.</li>
<li>Control how to format and display the dimension descriptions.</li>
<li>Identify the accounts or dimensions that have been omitted from report building blocks.</li>
<li>Format the headers for rolling forecasts.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can manage the generation and distribution of reports by using the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scheduling reports so that they are automatically generated on a daily, weekly, monthly, or annual basis.</li>
<li>Exporting the report result to the read-only PDF format, which provides better document security through digital signatures.</li>
<li>Exporting to a Microsoft Excel worksheet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interactive features let you perform the following tasks within Financial reporting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the report date for the report that you're viewing.</li>
<li>Change the currency of the report that you're viewing.</li>
<li>View the report in either a summary view or a detailed view.</li>
<li>Add dimension filters to limit the report content to a specific dimension or combination of dimensions.</li>
<li>Add attribute filters to limit the report content to a specific attribute or a combination of attributes.</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend that you link your main accounts to your main account categories. This makes it easier and faster when setting up your reporting in Financial reporting.</p>
<p>For example, if you are creating a report, rather than listing many main accounts, you can simply list your main account category and get a total of all the main accounts in that category.</p>
<h2 id="accessing-financial-reporting">Accessing financial reporting</h2>
<p>Before creating and generating the financial reports, ensure that the following items have been set up for your company:</p>
<ul>
<li>Currency</li>
<li>Fiscal calendar</li>
<li>Chart of accounts</li>
<li>Ledger</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find the <strong>Financial reporting</strong> menu in the following locations in Dynamics 365 Finance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>General Ledger &gt; Inquiries and reports</strong></li>
<li><strong>Budgeting &gt; Inquires and reports &gt; Basic budgeting</strong></li>
<li><strong>Budgeting &gt; Inquiries and reports &gt; Budget planning</strong></li>
<li><strong>Budgeting &gt; Inquiries and reports &gt; Budget control</strong></li>
<li><strong>Consolidations</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="financial-reporting-setup">Financial reporting setup</h2>
<p>The <strong>Financial reporting setup</strong> page in <strong>General ledger &gt; Ledger setup</strong> has a list of all financial dimensions in the system. It has two sections that determine the data that you will report on in Financial reporting:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dimensions tab</strong> - Because different companies use different dimensions and account structures, there is no way to determine the order in which users want to view all financial dimensions on reports. This page allows you to set the order in which you want financial dimensions to appear when you build and view a report in Financial reporting.</li>
<li><strong>Attributes tab</strong> - This is where you can select whether you want to use vendors and customers as attributes for filtering and report design. Reporting on vendor and customer will only be valuable if you do not enter multiple vendors or customers in a single voucher when posting transactions. Selecting <strong>Vendor</strong> and/or <strong>Customer</strong> will add more time to the integration.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="financial-reporting-components">Financial reporting components</h2>
<p>The following components of financial reporting make it easy to create, view, and schedule reports:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Report designer</strong> - Create report building blocks that can be combined to define and generate a report. Advanced users can create new report building blocks or modify existing building blocks to meet their requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Report schedules</strong> - Schedule a single report, or a group of reports, so that it is generated on a regular basis.</li>
</ul>
<p>The financial statement functionality simplifies your ability to build reporting structures for internal analytical purposes. You can create many financial reports to comply with requirements and international accounting standards.</p>
<p>There are two default balance sheet reports:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Balance Sheet – Default</strong> - The sections are stacked. Provides a view of the organization's financial position for the year.</li>
<li><strong>Side by Side Balance Sheet – Default</strong> The sections are side by side. Provides a view of the organization's financial position for the year. Assets and liability and shareholder’s equity are side by side.</li>
</ul>
<p>The three trial balance reports are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Detailed Trial Balance – Default</strong> - Provides balance information for all accounts, and includes debit and credit balances, and the net of these, together with the transaction date, voucher, and journal description.</li>
<li><strong>Summary Trial Balance – Default</strong> - Provides balance information for all accounts and includes opening and closing balances, and debit and credit balances, together with their net difference.</li>
<li><strong>Summary Trial Balance Year Over Year – Default</strong> - Provides balance information for all accounts and includes opening and closing balances, and debit and credit balances, together with their net difference for the current year and the past year.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Income Statement – Default</strong> report provides a view of the organization’s profitability for the current period and for the year to date.</p>
<h2 id="financial-report-retention-policies">Financial report retention policies</h2>
<p>As you run Financial reports, default expiration dates are applied to each one to automatically delete them after a period of time. Any reports can be retained for regulatory purposes, however, by using the Expiration feature in Financial reports. You have two choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>90 days</li>
<li>Never</li>
</ul>
<div class="mx-imgBorder">

</div>
<h2 id="row-definition">Row definition</h2>
<p>A row definition is a report component, or building block, that specifies the contents of each row on a financial report. It can be combined with column definitions, reporting tree definitions, and report definitions to create a building block group that can be used by multiple companies.</p>
<p>A row definition defines the descriptive lines (for example, salaries or sales) on a report. It also lists the segment values or dimensions that contain the values for each line item and includes row formatting and calculations.</p>
<p>You can use row definitions in the financial statements to present financial figures by the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial dimension</li>
<li>Main accounts</li>
<li>A combination of the two</li>
</ul>
<p>A row definition can contain up to 20,000 financial dimension rows and can include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Descriptive text that adds meaning to the report by creating section headings, lines, and spaces, such as Cash or Total revenue.</li>
<li>Links to financial data, which can include dimension values in finance and operations apps.</li>
<li>Row totals and formulas that are based on the linked financial data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually, each row in a row definition contains one of the following types of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>References to the financial dimensions system.</li>
<li>Totals or calculations that are based on the data.</li>
<li>Formatting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two methods for entering information in a row definition are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manually</strong> - Enter row information in a new row definition. For more information, see <a data-linktype="absolute-path" href="/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/modify-row-definition-cells-financial-reporting?azure-portal=true&amp;toc=%2Ffin-and-ops%2Ftoc.json">Modify row definition cells</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Use the Report designer</strong> - Use this to pull row information directly from the financial dimensions.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can set up a row definition to pull data from the financial dimensions system every time that the report is generated.</p>
<p>A dimension is an intersection of data and values. You can group data and values in the Report designer. Then, you can classify and analyze transactions in more detail. You can use the <strong>Insert rows</strong> function from <strong>Dimensions</strong> dialog box to add multiple rows to a row definition at the same time.</p>
<p>The following list describes the information that you can specify for each dimension:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dimension</strong> - The pattern that identifies the dimension to add to the row definition. This pattern contains one ampersand (&amp;) or number sign (#) for each position in the dimensions. If a dimension has an ampersand, then that dimension will populate the row definition. By default, it's set on the main account, which is the most common way to build a row definition.</li>
<li><strong>Dimension Range Start</strong> - The first value for this dimension to add to the row definition.</li>
<li><strong>Dimension Range End</strong> - The last value for this dimension to add to the row definition.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="column-definition">Column definition</h2>
<p>A column definition is a report component, or building block, that defines the contents of columns on a report. Like row definitions, basic column definitions can be used on multiple reports.</p>
<p>A column definition defines the period to use when data is extracted from the financial dimensions. It also includes column formatting and calculations. You can also restrict a report column to a specific unit or for specific dates.</p>
<p>Often, you might need to combine financial dimension sets to make detailed financial reports, which match the customer’s requirements. This helps companies to analyze transactions from the following transactions:</p>
<ul>
<li>General ledger</li>
<li>Budget</li>
</ul>
<p>You can add, modify, and delete the headers that appear at the top of the columns on a report. You can also configure conditional spanning column headers, based on the <strong>Period</strong> field from column definitions and the <strong>Base period</strong> field from report definitions. The base period feature helps save time when you create rolling forecast reports.</p>
<h2 id="reporting-tree-definition">Reporting tree definition</h2>
<p>A reporting tree definition helps define the structure and hierarchy of your organization. It's a cross-dimensional and cross-company hierarchical structure that is based on the dimensional relationships in your financial data. It provides information at the reporting unit level and at a summary level for all units in the tree.</p>
<p>Reporting tree definitions can be combined with column definitions and report definitions to create a building block group that can be used by multiple companies.</p>
<p>A reporting unit can be an individual department from the financial data, or it can be a higher-level summary unit that combines information from other reporting units. For a report definition that includes a reporting tree, one report is generated for each reporting unit and for the summary level.</p>
<p>Financial reports that aren't based on a reporting tree use only some of the capabilities of Financial reporting. You can use multiple reporting tree definitions together with the same row and column definitions to view your organization's data in various ways.
All these reports use the row and column definitions that are specified in the report definition, unless the report definition specifies that the reporting tree from the row definition should be used. Row and column definitions are important components in the design and functionality of financial reports.</p>
<h2 id="security-considerations">Security considerations</h2>
<p>You can create a password to lock and help protect a building block. In this way, you can add a level of security to a report component without securing the whole system.</p>
<p>A password can help protect building block information that is important to your month-end reporting process.
A user in any role can lock a building block. However, other users always have read-only access to a locked component. Users can open, change, and save the locked component under a new name.
A user who has the role of administrator can always access and change a locked building block.</p>

<p>In finance and operations apps, you can perform the following tasks with reports and inquiries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Export application reports as Word documents.</li>
<li>Export options while previewing documents.</li>
<li>Send documents to network printers while previewing online.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="export-application-reports-as-word-documents">Export application reports as Word documents</h2>
<p>By using Report Definition Language (RDL) based design definitions, a user can create editable documents. Dynamics 365 offers specific application solutions that allow you to access predetermined business views of Finance and Supply Chain Management apps data. When completed, the data can be exported to PDF, CSV, and other Microsoft Office formats.</p>
<p>In addition to the formats mentioned above, reports created using the cloud-hosted service can be downloaded as a standard Microsoft Word document.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<p>Note</p>
<p>A request for more than one report at a time results in a .ZIP file that must be downloaded and uncompressed before using the Word documents.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="export-options-while-previewing-documents">Export options while previewing documents</h2>
<p>Because most users prefer to view their documents before exporting them, toolbar options are available on all supported devices, providing a simple and intuitive solution for exporting documents. For more information on PDF previewing, see <a data-linktype="absolute-path" href="/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/preview-pdf-documents/?azure-portal=true">Preview PDF documents using a PDF viewer</a>.</p>

<p>Often, different countries and regions have legal requirements regarding the format for incoming and outgoing electronic documents. The Electronic reporting (ER) functionality manages those formats during their life cycle. Additionally, potential regular requirement changes by government bodies or banks mean that business documents must be updated accordingly.</p>
<p>The ER reporting functionality is intended for advanced business users because it is a matter of configuration and not code to maintain formats for electronic documents.</p>
<p>The following section explains the ER engine from a high level.</p>
<h2 id="capabilities">Capabilities</h2>
<p>ER functionality provides the following capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a single tool for electronic reporting and is a single source for what was previously 20 different engines that performed electronic reporting.</li>
<li>The format is applicable for different versions.</li>
<li>A custom format can be created that is based on another format. ER functionality will automatically upgrade the custom format when the original one is changed.</li>
<li>It is the primary standard tool to support localization.</li>
<li>Formats can be distributed through Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more technical information on the following electronic reporting topics, go to <a data-linktype="absolute-path" href="/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/general-electronic-reporting?azure-portal=true&amp;toc=/dynamics365/commerce/toc.json">Electronic reporting (ER) overview</a>.</p>

<h1 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">Configure electronic reporting</h1>


<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>Before you can start configuring the Electronic reporting functionality, set up the required document types in Document management:</p>
<ul>
<li>Office documents that are used as templates for reports</li>
<li>Storage for the output of ER reports in the jobs archive</li>
<li>Storage for the output of reports so that they can be viewed in other programs</li>
<li>Documents for keeping baselines of configuration output</li>
<li>Documents for handling files in the framework for all other purposes</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow these steps to set up the basic functionality of electronic reporting:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <strong>Electronic reporting</strong> workspace.</li>
<li>In the <strong>App links</strong> section, select <strong>Electronic reporting parameters</strong>.</li>
<li>On the <strong>General</strong> tab, turn on the <strong>Enable design mode</strong> option to enable the ER design experience to the current Finance instance.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Attachments</strong> tab, define the types of documents that should be used for file storage in the ER framework. Notice that in the <strong>Configurations</strong> section, the document type is a file with each legal entity, while all other document types are files or images.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Lifecycle Services</strong> tab, define the number of parallel threads that should be used to load an ER configuration from repositories in Lifecycle Services, so that the configurations are loaded in the most efficient manner. The value can vary from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>15</strong>, depending on the available resources of the current program. The real number of threads will be defined automatically based on this setting and on the number of other tasks and their priorities.</li>
<li>Close the page.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Configuration providers</strong>, you select a provider. Select the ellipses to see the <strong>Set active</strong> option. If the configuration is already active, the <strong>Set active</strong> option will be dimmed. The active provider's name and internet address are stored in an ER configuration as attributes of the configuration owner.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="create-a-new-configuration-provider">Create a new configuration provider</h2>
<p>In the <strong>USMF</strong> demo company in finance and operations apps, there is already a configuration provider. You can create a new configuration provider by going through the steps in the following sections. The newly created configuration providers are automatically shared with all legal entities.</p>

<h2 id="legal-entity-specific-parameters">Legal entity-specific parameters</h2>
<p>An advanced user can define corporate rules, which translate the terms to all the languages that are supported in finance and operations apps. This functionality allows business users to specify terms and conditions in their chosen language.</p>
<p>If a power user configures an independent rule for a legal entity, a field for the data source is defined to return values describing the configured rule. The entire path to this field is provided, thus enabling a power user to navigate to it quickly. Also, when electronic reporting format-specific company (legal entity) master data is set up, this feature enables a power user to define what areas of the search data source will be provided to a business user.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you can configure a legal entity-independent rule to return only the enumeration data type for each configured condition. An advanced user can also configure a rule to also return a text value.</p>

<h2 id="check-number-validation">Check number validation</h2>
<p>When you have generated a barcode, you can use Finance to validate check numbers. By validating check numbers, you can eliminate the risk of errors in processing checks preventing delays and additional fees.</p>
<p>There are two options to perform check number validation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Interval validation</strong> - Interval validation can be set up in the cash and bank management parameters by setting up a default check number interval. If your check number falls outside of your defined interval, you will be prompted with a warning message that notifies you of the issue.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Character validation</strong> - Character validation triggers a warning message when a character appears within the check number.</p>
