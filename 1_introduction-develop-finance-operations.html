data. Microsoft offers a cloud-based enterprise resource planning (ERP)
and retail solution that enables these organizations to meet these
needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Finance and operations apps</li>
<li>Dynamics 365 Commerce</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dynamics-365-human-resources">Dynamics 365 Human Resources</h3>
<p>The way we work, and the workplace, have fundamentally changed—and yet, for many businesses HR processes have not. When workforce practices are disconnected, the result is lower employee engagement and higher turnover rates. Employee disruption ultimately impacts the organization through a lack of product innovation, expensive operational errors, less satisfied customers, and suboptimal financial results.</p>
<p>Dynamics 365 Human Resources helps HR professionals get the workforce insights needed to build data-driven employee experiences across multiple areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compensation</li>
<li>Benefits</li>
<li>Leave and absence</li>
<li>Compliance</li>
<li>Payroll</li>
<li>Performance feedback</li>
<li>Training and certification</li>
<li>Self-service programs</li>
</ul>
<p>Dynamics 365 Human Resources connects people and operations data to ensure businesses can optimize workforce costs and take better care of employees.</p>
<h2 id="microsoft-power-platform">Microsoft Power Platform</h2>
<p>Microsoft Power Platform empowers people and organizations to innovate and
create applications for your business and connect to Dynamics 365
applications and external applications. The three applications
that make up Microsoft Power Platform include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Power Apps</strong> - Allows you to build powerful apps that meet
the needs your business, including task automation, data management,
and application extension functionality. All of this can be done
without writing a single line of code. By using Microsoft Dataverse, Power Apps enables you to consolidate business
data from multiple data sources.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Power BI</strong> - The reporting and analytics application that allows
you to embed intelligence into your applications. These visuals can
be built with your Dynamics 365 data to help you make sense of your
data and discover new insights to help decision making within the
business.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Power Automate</strong> - This service automates your business processes. With
more than 200 services included out of the box, Power Automate
enables you to create automated workflows that connect to services
both inside and outside of Dynamics 365 applications. This
application can provide guidance to ensure data and process
consistency throughout your organization. You can start from the beginning or use one of hundreds of available templates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="components-and-architecture-of-finance-and-operations-apps">Components and architecture of finance and operations apps</h2>
<p>Before you begin developing for finance and operations apps, you need to understand the major components and architecture of the application.
The application stack for Dynamics 365 is divided into platform models
and application-specific models. This module explores both the platform and application-specific models and their importance when developing for the application.</p>
<p>The architecture and developer experience for finance and operations apps is modeled to support a cloud-based application.</p>
<p>The division of the application stack for finance and operations apps allows
you to develop and customize the application by using the base foundation
models. The model-based development also drives how to develop for
finance and operations apps by using extensions, a less intrusive approach to
development compared to over layering.</p>
<p>To further understand this concept, consider the three key models in finance and operations apps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Application suite</strong> - This is the largest out-of-the-box
model. This model includes much of the metadata in the main
navigational areas of the application, including modules such as
Accounts receivable, Accounts payable, and Warehouse management.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Application foundation</strong> - This includes metadata that
comprises organizational modeling, number sequences in the system,
global address book, and source documentation.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Application platform</strong> - This contains runtime and data
access metadata, workflow and services, the Dynamics 365 client and
presentation, and SSRS reporting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="developer-environment">Developer environment</h2>
<p>Visual Studio is the integrated development environment (IDE) that is
used for all finance and operations apps development. As a developer, you
will work in your own development environment with access to Visual
Studio, which enables you to access all the developer tools and
components, including source control by using Azure DevOps. Because
multiple developers are generally developing for the application at a
single time, Azure DevOps is required for source control. This topic
is discussed in further detail in <a data-linktype="absolute-path" href="/en-us/training/modules/manage-source-code-version-control-finance-operations/?azure-portal=true">Manage source code by using version control in finance and operations apps</a>.</p>
<p>At a high level, it's important to understand that you will use Visual
Studio to develop for finance and operations apps, manage
code on your team with source control by using Azure DevOps, perform builds and testing, and create deployable packages.</p>
<div class="modular-content-container" hidden="" id="next-section">

</div>
<div class="section is-uniform position-relative" id="unit-inner-section">
<h1 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">Finance + Operations on-premises and cloud-based finance and operations apps</h1>
<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>You can deploy finance and operations apps in the cloud, or Finance + Operations (on-premises). As a
developer, it's important for you to understand the difference between these architectures. Depending on the type of deployment that your organization chooses, architecture and the application capabilities might vary.</p>
<h2 id="cloud-architecture">Cloud architecture</h2>
<p>Cloud deployments offer a service that is fully managed by Microsoft. By
choosing a cloud deployment, the application is simple to scale up or down, depending on the needs of the business, with data centers that are all managed by Microsoft. Cloud architecture has several benefits, including shorter implementation, fewer required customizations, and a reduced cost for IT infrastructure.</p>
<p>Cloud deployments allow customers to stay current in a consistent,
predictable, and seamless manner. This cadence, which allows continuous
updates of the application, aims to lower upgrade costs, provide
everyone access to the latest capabilities, improve performance, and
offer a better support experience.</p>
<p>The architecture for cloud deployment includes several main components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Subscription</strong> - A subscription to finance and operations apps gives
you an online cloud environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Licenses</strong> - Customers must purchase subscription licenses (SLs)
for their organization or for their affiliates' employees and
on-site agents, vendors, or contractors who directly or indirectly
access finance and operations apps. finance and operations apps are licensed
through Volume Licensing and the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)
program. See <a data-linktype="external" href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544&amp;clcid=0x409">Microsoft Dynamics 365 Licensing guide</a> for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Entra ID</strong> - Microsoft Entra ID is the multi-tenant,
cloud-based directory and identity management service from Microsoft
that combines core directory services, application access
management, and identity protection in a single solution. Finance
and operations uses Microsoft Entra ID as the store for identity. Access to Microsoft Entra ID is provided as part of a subscription to finance and operations apps.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Tenant</strong> - In Microsoft Entra ID, a tenant represents an organization. This is a dedicated instance of the Microsoft Entra ID service that an organization receives and owns when it creates a relationship with Microsoft (for example, by signing up for a Microsoft cloud service such as Azure, Intune, or Microsoft 365). Every Microsoft Entra tenant is distinct and separate from other Microsoft Entra tenants.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft 365 Admin help center</strong> - A subscription management portal that
Microsoft 365 provides for administrators. It's used to provide
management functions through Microsoft Entra ID and subscriptions. As
part of these management functions, it provides information about
service health.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Lifecycle Services</strong> - Is a collaboration portal that
provides an environment and a set of regularly updated services that
can help you manage the application lifecycle of your finance and
operations implementations.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Azure DevOps</strong> - Used primarily for code version control and to
deploy a build environment. Azure DevOps is also used to track
support incidents, such as work items in Azure DevOps that are
submitted to Microsoft through cloud-powered support, and to
integrate the Business Process Modeler (BPM) library hierarchy into
your Azure DevOps project as a hierarchy of work items. Azure DevOps
is also used during code upgrades.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finance and operations apps use many features of the Azure platform, such as
Azure Storage, networking, monitoring, and Azure SQL Database. Shared
services put into operation and orchestrate the application lifecycle of
the environments. Together, Azure functionality and Lifecycle Services offer a robust
cloud service.</p>
<h2 id="on-premises-architecture">On-premises architecture</h2>
<p>Finance + Operations can be deployed on-premises. This means that the
application is deployed locally within the customer's datacenter, and
the datacenter is managed by the customer. It's important to remember
that because an on-premises deployment is locally deployed, system
requirements, hardware sizing, and functionality of the application
differs from cloud deployments.</p>
<p>When an on-premises deployment is selected, the application servers and
the Microsoft SQL Server database are run in the customer's datacenter.
Identical to a cloud deployment, Lifecycle Services is used to manage the on-premises
deployment. To build and manage an enterprise-class, high-scale
application, on-premises deployments use Microsoft Azure Server Service
standalone clusters. The Service Fabric standalone clusters can be
installed on any machine that is running Windows Server. There are two
types of clusters: one for sandboxes and one for production
environments. Application Object Servers (AOS), Financial Reports
Designer (formally named Management Reporter), and SQL Server Reporting
Services (SSRS) are roles that are deployed in both the production and
sandbox clusters.</p>
<p>When deciding which type of deployment your organization should use, you
should consider the overall approach of the implementation and
the management of the infrastructure. Additional considerations include
the organizational preferences to meet regulatory and compliance needs
of the business. With a cloud deployment, the structure is completely
managed by Microsoft. With an on-premises deployment, the customer takes
on more responsibility and has additional costs. Examples of additional
costs could include standing up your own infrastructure, configuring a
high-availability disaster recovery solution, standing up sandbox
environments, and managing the infrastructure.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that there are differences in features
that are available for cloud and on-premises deployments. Microsoft
offers a list of specific features that differ from each of the
deployment types. For more information, see the Summary unit at the end of this module.</p>

<h1 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">Development and deployment processes</h1>
<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>An AOT package is a deployment and compilation unit of one or more
models that can be applied to a finance and operations apps environment. A
deployable package can consist of several models that contain the
metadata, binaries, reports, and other resources. The deployable package
is used for deployment of code and customizations to the sandbox, test,
and production environments for the application.</p>
<h2 id="development-and-deployment-process">Development and deployment process</h2>
<p>Before you begin developing for finance and operations apps, make sure that you understand the developer and deployment process, which will help make these processes run smoothly.</p>
<p><img alt="Diagram of the developer and deployment process." data-linktype="relative-path" src="./rawmb500/media_deploy_process.png"/></p>
<p>All developers for the application work in an individual environment that includes the Visual Studio application. As a reminder, Visual Studio is the integrative development environment (IDE) that is used to develop for Dynamics 365. Deployable packages are created in Visual Studio and then deployed to sandbox, test, and production environments by using Lifecycle Services.</p>
<p>When finishing your code and customizations in Visual Studio, you must make a few considerations. If several developers are on one project, you should perform a Get Latest process to merge all new code that has been checked in by the other developers, and then perform a local build
to ensure that your code will not disturb what is in the Azure DevOps repository.</p>
<p>When both processes have been performed, you can check in your code by using Team Explorer, which is connected to Azure DevOps. The code that is checked in will be built in Azure DevOps by using a build pipeline, and this will create a deployable package. Generally, you will not deploy your own code. By using Lifecycle Services, you can apply a deployable package by using the <strong>Apply updates</strong> tool.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-deployable-package-in-visual-studio">Create a deployable package in Visual Studio</h3>
<p>We recommend that you use a build environment to create a
deployable package, though these can be created in a developer
environment.</p>
<p>When code is complete and builds successfully, you can follow these
steps to create a deployable package in Visual Studio:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In Visual Studio, select <strong>Extensions &gt; Dynamics 365</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select <strong>Deploy &gt; Create Deployment Package</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="Graphic of the Create deployment package dialog.
" data-linktype="relative-path" src="./rawmb500/media_create_deployment_package.png"/></p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Create Deployment Package</strong> dialog, select the packages
that contain the models that you want to deploy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can select the <strong>Referenced packages</strong> drop-down arrow to view
all the dependent models of the models that are selected.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Package file location</strong> field, you can select the ellipsis '…' to select where you want to save the package file.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When you have selected all the models for the deployable package, select <strong>Create</strong>. A zip file will be saved to the location that you specified.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="production-deployment">Production deployment</h2>
<p>To deploy to production, customers can schedule a downtime that will determine when an update will be applied to the production environment by Microsoft. To schedule downtime to apply updates to the environment, the package must have been applied to at least one sandbox environment in the same project. You can submit a service request for this in Lifecycle Services.</p>

<h1 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">The user interface</h1>
<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>As a developer, you should explore the finance and operations apps user interface and become familiar with the functionality in the application. By exploring the user interface, you can develop better code to help users complete their tasks. When you begin using finance and operations apps, you will notice that Dynamics 365 has a familiar appearance and behavior across the entire Dynamics 365 ecosystem.</p>
<p>Functionality in the finance and operations apps user interface provides
key components that enable you to work more efficiently.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Navigation search</strong> - Any page that is accessed by using the  <strong>Navigation pane</strong> menu (the left-most pane) is also available from the <strong>Search</strong> field. You can press <strong>Alt + G</strong> to move focus to the <strong>Search</strong> field, and then type the name of the finance and operations apps page. The <strong>Search</strong> field spans the top of the application user interface.</li>
<li><strong>Action search</strong> - While every action that is provided on a page can be manually accessed from the keyboard, pages often have a lot of actions. The Action search functionality allows you to quickly and efficiently perform actions that you know the names of and with just a few keystrokes. You can press <strong>Alt + G</strong> to move focus to the <strong>Search</strong> field, and then start typing the name of the action. Usually after a few letters, the action you are looking for will be high in the results list.</li>
<li><strong>Workspaces</strong> - Workspaces enable users to be more productive in their daily tasks by providing a single page that they can work from to perform the operations they do daily. Several workspaces come out of the box with finance and operations apps. Workspaces can also be created and modified in the user interface with no development.</li>
<li><strong>User personalization</strong> - Users can personalize pages in finance and operations apps. Many types of personalization exist, including user options, where you can select a color theme and time zone. Personalization can also be used to change the way the user interface is displayed. For example, a user can specify how pages display when they are first opened. Personalization can also modify the appearance of a page. For example, you can hide, move, and rearrange columns on a grid. Note that user personalization is for that specific user, regardless of the type of personalization.</li>
<li><strong>Task recorder</strong> - In finance and operations apps, the Task recorder focuses on high-responsiveness, a flexible extensibility application programming interface, and seamless integrations with consumers of business process recordings. The Task recorder has integrations with the Lifecycle Services Business process modeler (BPM) tool, which enables you to create business process diagrams from task recordings for analyzing and designing applications. You can use task recordings to create guided experiences through a business process, generate training documents that feature screenshots of the user interface at each step, and build tests that validate your code.</li>
<li><strong>Office integrations</strong> - Several Office integrations that are offered in finance and operations apps help increase productivity. Office interactions include the Excel Data Connector add-in. This add-in allows you to export data from finance and operations apps to a Microsoft Excel workbook, including adding, modifying, and deleting records. The add-in also has a Workbook Designer that enables you to design an editable custom export workbook that contains an entity and set of fields. Other office integrations include document management to save records to the Azure Blob Storage.</li>

<h1 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">Reporting capabilities</h1>
<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>As a developer, you might need to develop reporting to meet the needs of
the business. Therefore, you should understand the types of reporting in finance and operations apps and their capabilities so that you can determine the type of report that should be developed.</p>
<p>Several reporting options are available for you to use, including SSRS, Power BI, and Financial Reporting.</p>
<h2 id="ssrs-reporting">SSRS reporting</h2>
<p>Reports can be defined simply as any visualization of a structured data
set. This might include transactional data that is presented in a tabular layout and advanced graphical views of aggregate information. To account for this broad definition, finance and operations apps offers several tools to
produce reports that satisfy complex business requirements. One of these
tools is SSRS.</p>
<p><a data-linktype="relative-path" href="media/ssrs-report.svg#lightbox"><img alt="Screenshot of the Vendor aging SSRS report." data-linktype="relative-path" src="./rawmb500/media_ssrs_report.png"/></a></p>
<p>SSRS reports provide the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Back-office document management capabilities, including email
support, scheduled batch implementations, and print archive
functionality.</li>
<li>Parameterized views with drill-through navigation to finance and operations apps pages and other reports.</li>
<li>Production of precision documents for compliance with local
regulatory business practices.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="power-bi">Power BI</h2>
<p>Finance and operations apps let you pin tiles, dashboards, and reports from
your PowerBI.com account to workspaces. You can configure Power BI by navigating to <strong>System administration &gt; Setup &gt; PowerBI.com configuration.</strong></p>
<p>Finance and operations apps delivers interactive reports that are integrated into application workspaces. Workspaces can use rich
infographics and visuals that are supported by Power BI. These
infographics and visuals include many controls that are provided by
third parties. Therefore, workspaces can provide a highly visual,
interactive experience. You can interact with data by selecting or
touching visuals on the page to see cause and effect, and you can perform simple what-if operations without leaving the workspace.</p>

<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>An understanding of the underlying architecture of finance and operations will help you appreciate the rich functionality
of the user interface. Some architecture components can vary between
cloud and on-premises deployments. The on-premises deployment is named Dynamics 365 Finance + Operations (on-premises).</p>
<p>Cloud deployments offer a service that is fully managed by Microsoft,
while on-premises deployments are deployed locally within a customer's
datacenter. Methodologies differ between cloud-hosted and on-premises
deployments. The deployment that a business uses will be based on who the
desired data trustee is and who will manage the application lifecycle.</p>
<h2 id="finance-and-operations-apps-cloud-deployment">Finance and operations apps cloud deployment</h2>
<p>A cloud deployment provides multiple benefits, including reduced
implementation time, lower hardware and infrastructure costs, and
less invasive development. One of the main benefits of choosing a
cloud deployment is that the ERP service is fully managed by Microsoft.
Therefore, cloud deployments are a software as a service (SaaS) offering. This enables organizations to easily scale up or down depending
on the needs of the business. Cloud deployments also allow customers to
stay current in a consistent, predictable, and seamless manner. This
cadence, which allows continuous updates of the application, aims to
lower upgrade costs, provide everyone access to the latest capabilities,
improve performance, and offer a better support experience.</p>
<h2 id="finance--operations-on-premises-deployment">Finance + Operations (on-premises) deployment</h2>
<p>When deciding which type of deployment your organization should use, you
should consider the overall approach of the implementation and
the management of the infrastructure. Additional considerations include
the organizational preferences to meet regulatory and compliance needs
of the business. In these types of situations, an on-premises deployment
might be chosen.</p>
<p>Organizations that choose to deploy Finance + Operations also need to take ownership of various tasks that would have otherwise been carried out by Microsoft. These tasks include configuring
high-availability solutions, disaster recovery solutions, and sandbox
environments. Keep in mind that there are functionality differences between on-premises deployments and cloud deployments.</p>
<p>For more information about the differences between cloud and on-premises architecture, see the link in the <strong>Summary</strong> unit at the end of this module.</p>

<h1 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">Elements, models, and packages</h1>
<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>Elements, models, and packages represent the structural hierarchy in
Visual Studio for finance and operations. Elements either exist out of
the box in the application explorer (AOT) in Visual Studio, or they can be
created. Elements are metadata and source files, such as base
enumerations and tables. A <strong>Finance Operations</strong> project is used to
organize and manage elements within a model. Models contain zero or more
elements. For example, the warehouse management model is a group of
elements that make up the warehouse management solution.</p>
<p><img alt="Diagram of the elements of the technical architecture." data-linktype="relative-path" src="./rawmb500/media_elements_to_packages_1.png"/></p>
<p>All models belong to packages, which can then be packaged together to
create a deployable package and then deployed by using Lifecycle Services. A deployable package contains one or multiple packages that are used for runtime environments. Wizards in Visual Studio are used to create models and projects, and the designer window is used to customize elements within projects and models.</p>
<p>Deployable packages are deployed to finance and operations environments. These packages contain models that, in many cases, represent
the modules that are visible in the user interface, such as Accounts payable. The models contain the elements that represent every field, menu, and page that is found in the user interface. These elements are created and managed in Visual Studio. Therefore, source control using Azure DevOps is required for finance and operations development.</p>
<p>The following image shows the <strong>Application Explorer</strong> window in Visual
Studio.</p>

<li>Select <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="build-models">Build models</h2>
<p>Before you create a deployable package, you should perform a model build. You may also need to perform a model to resolve errors you might be getting while working on a development project. To build models, follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>In Visual Studio, select <strong>Extensions</strong> in the top menu</li>
<li>Select <strong>Dynamics 365 &gt; Build models</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Packages</strong> list, select the packages that you want to build. The models that are related to the packages are listed in brackets.</li>
<li>Optionally, you can select <strong>Build referenced packages</strong> to build    dependent packages first.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Options</strong> tab, you can select from multiple build
processes. These processes increase the build time, so if you do not    need to run the process, leave the following options cleared.
<ul>
<li><strong>Build Pre-Compiled Forms</strong> - Static HTML is generated for each form during the build to allow faster rendering of forms at runtime.</li>
<li><strong>Build reports</strong> - Builds reports.</li>
<li><strong>Build Aggregate Measurements</strong> - Builds aggregate
measurements.</li>
<li><strong>Run Best Practice Checks</strong> - Best practice checks are
performed during the build.</li>
<li><strong>Synchronize database</strong> - Updates the SQL database schema        during the build.</li>
<li><strong>Build cross reference data</strong> - Data for the cross-reference        feature is updated to allow developers to find references to code and metadata.</li>

<h1 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">Application components and architecture</h1>
<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>Finance and operations apps are based on a model-driven architecture. The core functionality and some major functional features are segregated into various models. Element-level dependency is defined among all these models, building a robust application architecture for finance and operations apps. Application architecture is divided into platform models and application-specific models.</p>
<h2 id="platform-models">Platform models</h2>
<p>The platform models are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Application platform</li>
<li>Application foundation</li>
<li>Test essentials</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="application-platform">Application platform</h3>
<p>Application platform is the core model to implement any functionality of finance and operations apps. Hence, this model is included as a referenced model by default when any custom model is created. It's not possible to remove the reference to this model.</p>
<p>The major application areas of the Application platform model are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Runtime and Data access</strong> - The Application platform is the lowest model and contains the lowest level elements that communicate with the kernel.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Workflow and services</strong> - Workflow is a common functionality in finance and operations apps that represents a business process. It defines how a document flows, or moves, through the system by showing who must complete a task, make a decision, or approve a document. Standard workflows are already available for all apps. You can build custom workflows on the framework as desired.</p>
<p>Application platform enables users to develop custom services for finance and operations apps. When a developer writes a custom service under a service group, the service group is always deployed on two endpoints:</p>
<ul>
<li>SOAP endpoint</li>
<li>JSON endpoint</li>
</ul>
<p>Finance and operations apps also provide for OData Service and REST Metadata service, both of which can be used for integration purposes.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Client and Presentation</strong> - Finance and operations apps are designed to deal with complex business transactions in a user-friendly interface through different devices, such as laptops, tablets, or mobile phones. The web client, which users can access from their PC or laptop, is the most used interface. Several concepts are offered in the <strong>Presentation</strong> layer of the application, such as dashboard and workspace. These concepts are all configurable components that you can drill down to the core transaction in each module.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>SSRS reporting</strong> - Each module of finance and operations apps has major standard reports, which are developed in SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS). SSRS can connect to the business data of finance and operations apps and can create custom reports by using two methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Query based</li>
<li>Data provider</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By using the query-based approach, you can develop simple reports. To develop complex business logic in reporting, the data provider approach is more appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="application-foundation">Application foundation</h3>
<p>The Application foundation model defines major functional features that are the foundation of other modules. The components of this model are the basic setup of the implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organization structure</strong> - An organization is a group of entities that work together to carry out a business process or achieve a goal. Organizational hierarchies represent the relationships between the organizations that make up the business. Different internal organizations are legal entities, operating units, and teams.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A <strong>legal entity</strong> is the most important configuration of any implementation that represents a registered and legislated legal structure. Legal entities can enter into legal contracts and are required to prepare statements that report on their performance.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An <strong>operating unit</strong> is an organization that is used to divide the control of economic resources and operational processes in a business.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A <strong>team</strong> is an organization in which the members share a common responsibility, interest, or objective. Teams can't be used in organizational hierarchies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Number sequence</strong> - Use this component to generate readable, unique identifiers for master data records and transaction records that require identifiers. Number sequence in finance and operations apps has a robust framework that can regulate numbering based on individual/shared legal entity/operating unit combined with the fiscal calendar period.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Global address book</strong> - This component is a data model for contact information that's stored for all internal and external persons and organizations that the company interacts with. The data that's associated with party records includes the party's name, address, and contact information. It includes a directory of postal and electronic addresses of the organizations and individuals that interact with a business.</p>
<p>Depending on the business context, a person or an organization might play more than one role, and the same postal address and electronic address might be used for all roles. In this case, a change of address in one role should appear in all other roles. The global address book stores and handles addresses globally.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Source document</strong> - The Source document framework provides functionality that's necessary to record business events and create accounting for the newly created document, such as accounting distributions and subledger journal entries.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="test-essentials">Test essentials</h3>
<p>Finance and operations apps have a robust test framework that help conduct different testing procedures. You can create a test module to manage test code by using FormAdaptors. After the base test module is in place, you can import Task Recorder to generate test code. When you import a Task Recorder recording XML file, test code will be generated by using FormAdaptors.</p>
<p>FormAdaptors are wrapper classes over forms that provide strongly typed APIs that you can use to test form functionality. Pre-generated FormAdaptors are available for each package for built-in forms. In the test module, you can add reference to the corresponding FormAdaptors for packages along with the Test Essentials package reference, which has helper methods to run test code.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a data-linktype="absolute-path" href="/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/perf-test/testing-support/?azure-portal=true">Test projects in Visual Studio</a>.</p>
<h2 id="application-specific-models">Application-specific models</h2>
<p>Many application-specific models are available, including Application suite, Ledger, Retail, and Case management.</p>
<p>Standard models for different functional features are also available. Application suite is the most important model that covers major functionality.</p>
<h3 id="application-suite">Application suite</h3>
<p>Application suite sits on top of Application foundation, and it contains application-specific elements. The Application suite model contains components of Supply Chain Management, Human Resources, Finance, and more. For enhancement in those modules, new custom models are created that reference the Application suite.</p>
<h2 id="other-models">Other models</h2>
<p>Other models, such as Currency, Directory, Contacts, and more, cover individual functionalities that are available in the application stack. Based on the extensibility requirement, these models are referenced to enhance functional features.</p>
<h2 id="dynamics-365-product-suite">Dynamics 365 product suite</h2>
<p>Dynamics 365 is a business application that consists of several solutions, such as Sales, Marketing, Service, Finance, Commerce, and Supply Chain Management. The latter three are considered the finance and operations apps.</p>
<div class="modular-content-container" hidden="" id="next-section">

<div class="section is-uniform position-relative" id="unit-inner-section">
<h1 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">Metadata management processes</h1>
<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>Finance and operations uses metadata to define elements. Metadata can be
used to search for elements like forms, tables, and code by using the
<strong>Metadata search</strong> feature. Metadata search can be accessed from <strong>Visual Studio &gt; Dynamics 365 &gt; Metadata search</strong>. Searching elements based on metadata allows you to find related elements.</p>
<p>For example, you might need to find a table but can’t remember the full
name. You know that "cust" is part of the name. You can use the metadata
search to find all the tables that have "cust" in the name. You can search elements based on the name of the element, type of element, model that the element is in, properties of the element, and code snippets.</p>
<p>The syntax for searching in the <strong>Metadata search</strong> is:</p>
<p>
*<filter_1>:<filter_1_value> [<filter_2>:<filter_2_value>... <filter_N>:<filter_N_value>]*
</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of metadata search in Visual
Studio." data-linktype="relative-path" src="./rawmb500/media_metadata_search_1.png"/></p>
<p>Keywords that you can use in the <strong>Metadata search</strong> include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong> - Filter by element name. This is also the default filter  if no keyword is specified. A comma can be used to search for multiple element names.</li>
<li><strong>Type</strong> - Filter by element type. A comma can be used after an    element to specify sub elements.</li>
<li><strong>Model</strong> - Filter by model name. Each comma-separated value will    look for a model in your application.</li>
<li><strong>Property</strong> - Filters properties on forms. Each comma-separated    value should be a property on the form.</li>
<li><strong>Code</strong> - Filter code snippets. The code snippet should be in    quotes.</li>
</ul>

<h1 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">Source control processes</h1>
<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>Developers rely on source control to track code changes and discover
differences among content that is created by various developers. Finance and operations uses Azure DevOps for source control, which is accessible
through a web browser or Visual Studio by using the Team Explorer.</p>
<h2 id="azure-devops-formerly-visual-studio-team-services">Azure DevOps, formerly Visual Studio Team Services</h2>
<p>Azure DevOps is a cloud-based offering, which is also backed
by a 99.9 percent service level agreement (SLA). While the core services are the same between cloud and on-premises, cloud also offers immediate access to new features, improved connectivity to remote locations, and simplified server management.</p>
<h2 id="azure-devops">Azure DevOps</h2>
<p>Azure DevOps is used as the source control service when developing for finance and operations apps. If you're upgrading from previous versions of Dynamics AX, you may be aware of Team Foundation Services for source control, this has been replaced by Azure DevOps. As a developer, you will need to ensure Azure DevOps is set up and configured before you start developing.</p>
<p>To enable source control through Azure DevOps, you need to go to
<a data-linktype="external" href="https://www.visualstudio.com/?azure-portal=true%22visualstudio.com%22">https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/</a>
and sign up for Azure DevOps to create
your account. When you create your account, you select a URL for
it. This will be the URL that you connect to from your
development computer when you configure source control. When your
account is created, or if you already have an account, create a new
project.</p>
<p>To configure your Visual Studio environment to connect to your team project, follow these
steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>Visual Studio</strong> as an administrator.</li>
<li>Open the <strong>Solution explorer</strong> if it isn't already displaying by selecting <strong>File &gt; Solution explorer</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Team explorer</strong> tab at the bottom of the window.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Manage connections</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Connect to team project</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Servers…</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Add/Remove Team Foundation Server</strong> window, select <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Paste the URL for your Azure DevOps project in the <strong>Name</strong> or <strong>URL</strong> of <strong>Team Foundation Server</strong> field.</li>
</ol>
<div class="NOTE">
<p>Note</p>
<p>It will likely look like this example: <em>https://projectname.visualstudio.com</em></p>
</div>
<ol start="9">
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Close</strong>.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Connect to Team Foundation Server</strong> window, use the dropdown to select the project you just added.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Connect</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you are connected to the Team Foundation Server, you need to map your Azure DevOps project to your local model store and projects folders.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <strong>Source Control Explorer</strong> from <strong>Team Explorer</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Source Control Explorer</strong>, select the <strong>Workspace</strong> dropdown at the top ribbon of the explorer.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Workspaces..</strong> and you see a list of workspaces.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Edit</strong> for the first workspace you see.</li>
<li>Map the <strong>Metadata</strong> folder of your team project to the root folder of the model store on your local drive (this is typically K:/AosService/PackagesLocalDirectory).</li>
<li>Select <strong>Map</strong>.</li>
<li>On the next dialog, select <strong>No</strong>.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps for the <strong>Projects</strong> folder. You typically map the <strong>Projects</strong> folder to C:\Users[Admin Account name]\Documents\Visual Studio [VS Year]\Projects where <strong>Projects</strong> is a folder you create.</li>
</ol>
<p>When creating a new Visual Studio project, you can add the project to
source control. Source control enables version control on elements in
Visual Studio. Version control forces you to check code out while developers are making changes to code.</p>
<p><a data-linktype="relative-path" href="media/add-source-control.png#lightbox"> <img alt="Screenshot of the New Project page highlighting the Add to Source Control check box." data-linktype="relative-path" src="./rawmb500/media_add_source_control.png"/> </a></p>
<p>When you have finished making your changes, you must check in your changes.
Each check-in creates a new version of that element. This process allows other developers to see who made changes, what changes were made to an element, and when the changes were made. It also allows you to revert code to a previous version if errors are found in the current version. When you check in code, other developers can also then perform <strong>Get latest</strong> to merge all the latest available versions of the code.</p>
<p>When you perform a <strong>Get latest</strong>, you might come across some change
conflicts, where a new version of code conflicts with what you have
currently built in your code base. You can view and resolve conflict in
Visual Studio on the <strong>Resolve conflicts</strong> page.</p>
<p>Three panes are available on the <strong>Resolve conflicts</strong> page:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Left pane</strong> - Shows your current code</li>
<li><strong>Right pane</strong> - Displays the new code</li>
<li><strong>Bottom pane</strong> - Displays what the automatic merge code looks like</li>
</ul>
<p>You can select to accept the automatic merge or individually accept
which code is merged or overridden.</p>
<h2 id="branching-and-merging">Branching and merging</h2>
<p>Finance and operations uses branching to isolate individual software
assets, which allows you to work in parallel with other developers to
increase productivity. Branching requires more effort to merge
code. No defined rule exists for how branches are set up, but there's usually a Development, Test, and Production or Release branch. A Development branch is used
for code that isn't ready for testing; however, it's shared between
developers. Some larger teams might use multiple developer branches. The Test
branch is used to hold changes that are ready to be tested by other
users. The Production branch holds all the source code exactly as it's
deployed in the production environment.</p>
<p>You must create a deployable package to move code changes from one
environment to another. We recommend that you use a build environment to
create deployable packages that contain all changes. You can create
deployable packages from the development environment.</p>
<p>To create a deployable package, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Dynamics 365 &gt; Deploy &gt; Create Deployment Package</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the packages that contain your models.</li>
<li>Enter a location to create the deployable package.</li>
<li>After the deployable package is created, sign in to Lifecycle Services.</li>
<li>Go to your Lifecycle Services project.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Asset Library</strong>.</li>
<li>Upload the deployable package that you created.</li>
</ol>
<p>To deploy a package to a nonproduction environment or a production
environment, you use Lifecycle Services. The process to deploy the package differs
between the two. Also, a deployment to a production environment requires
the package to successfully deploy to at least one sandbox environment
in the same project.</p>
<p>To deploy a package to a nonproduction environment, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <strong>Environment details</strong> view for the desired environment.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Maintain &gt; Apply updates</strong>.</li>
<li>Use the filter to select the package to apply.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Apply</strong>. The status in the upper-right corner of the <strong>Environment details</strong> view changes from Queued to In Progress.</li>
<li>When the package has been applied, the environment status changes to Deployed and the servicing status changes to Completed.</li>
</ol>
<p>To deploy a package to a production environment, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your project's asset library in Lifecycle Services.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Asset library</strong> page, select the <strong>Software deployable package</strong> tab, then select the package that you want to move to production,</li>
<li>Select <strong>Release candidate</strong>. This indicates that this package is ready for production deployment.</li>
<li>Select the package you wish to apply in your production environment, and then Select <strong>Schedule</strong> to submit a request to apply it.</li>
<li>Specify the <strong>date</strong> and <strong>time</strong> to schedule the package application.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Submit</strong>, and then select <strong>OK</strong> to confirm.</li>
<li>At the scheduled downtime, package deployment starts.</li>
<li>After the environment is serviced, you can monitor the status. The Servicing status field indicates the status of package application. Additionally, a progress indicator shows the number of steps that have been run, out of the total number of steps that are available.</li>
<li>After the deployment is successfully completed, the <strong>Servicing status</strong> field is set to <strong>Completed</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="NOTE">
<p>Note</p>
<p>If package application isn't successfully completed, Microsoft investigates the issue. The Servicing status field indicates that package application has failed. The environment is rolled back to a good state.</p>
</div>
<p>While the production environment is being updated, the environment is unavailable. You can monitor the <strong>Servicing status</strong> field to monitor the status of the package application. When the deployment is
complete, the servicing status reads <strong>Completed</strong>. The deployable
package has now been applied to the production environment.</p>

<p>When coding, developers should be mindful of best practices to ensure that their code meets an organization's policies. When performing a build in Visual Studio, the system will run a best practices check, and the
output window will display best practice errors or warnings. Developers
can also choose to code their own best practice rules by using the Code
Best Practice Framework or by deriving a class from the
<strong>BestPracticeMetadataChecker</strong>. The Code Best Practice
Framework is used to analyze and diagnose problems with X++ source code.</p>
<p>Global best practices that you should consider when writing code include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comments should be used in code so that others understand the purpose  and approach of the code. This is the best way for developers to communicate, and often multiple developers are modifying and maintaining code at the same time.</li>
<li>When creating new elements, you should use a naming standard with your organization.</li>
<li>Each element should have a label added in the <strong>Properties</strong> window to provide text for that element in the user interface.</li>

<h1 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">Overview of Lifecycle Services</h1>
<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>Lifecycle Services is a tool that aids developers in managing the lifecycle of finance and operations implementations. To use Lifecycle Services, go to
<a data-linktype="external" href="https://lcs.dynamics.com/v2/?azure-portal=true">https://lcs.dynamics.com</a> and sign in with your Microsoft Entra ID credentials. Lifecycle Services provides several tools that you can use to deploy and maintain your cloud-based or on-premises environments.</p>
<p>For cloud-based solutions, Lifecycle Services has a tool named Cloud-hosted
environments. This tool can be used to deploy your finance and operations environments on Microsoft Entra ID. You can use the tool to select the
type of environment that you want to deploy: Demo, Developer, or Test. Based on your selection, the tool provisions the appropriate
number of virtual machines in Microsoft Entra ID with all the needed prerequisites
installed on them.</p>
<p>For on-premises implementations of finance and operations, you will need
to set up an on-premises project in Lifecycle Services. In your Lifecycle Services project, go to
<strong>Environment &gt; Sandbox &gt; Configure</strong>. In the primary domain
controller virtual machine, you will need to run this script in the
PowerShell:</p>
<p>
.\Get-DeploymentSettings.ps1 -ConfigurationFilePath .\ConfigTemplate.xml
</p>
<p>For new deployments, select your environment topology, and complete the wizard to start the deployment of your environment.</p>
<p>To deploy code to on-premises environments, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Upload a deployable package to the Lifecycle Services Asset Library by going to the <strong>Software deployable package</strong> tab and selecting the plus (<strong>+</strong>)    button.</li>
<li>In your Lifecycle Services project, select either the sandbox or production
environment.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Configure</strong>.</li>
<li>In the deployment tool, enter the environment name.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Advanced settings</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Customize solution assets</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Select the AOT packages to be deployed</strong> field, select the deployable package.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Done</strong>.</li>
<li>Redeploy the environment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lifecycle Services also has tools to maintain your environment and implementation of finance and operations apps and Finance + Operations (on-premises), such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Projects and methodologies that track tasks and milestones that are required to receive a production environment.</li>
<li>You can use Lifecycle Services to estimate the number of licenses that you will need.</li>
<li>You can monitor the status of environments from the <strong>Detailed    environment</strong> page.</li>
<li>There is an issue search to find existing workarounds and solutions    for common problems.</li>
<li>All upgrades and updates are scheduled through Lifecycle Services.</li>
<li>You can use Lifecycle Services to copy data from one environment to another.</li>

<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>In this module you have learned that the underlying architecture of finance and operations apps, and Finance + Operations (on-premises), is comprised of
metadata, including elements, models, and packages. You have seen the foundation and work that goes into coding in Visual Studio for the
user interface. There are ways to manage source control for coding,
including Azure DevOps, and that coding should adhere to an
organization's best practices and policies.</p>
<p>Lifecycle Services is used throughout an implementation to manage a finance and operations apps deployment.</p>
<p>Deployments can be either cloud-based and hosted in Azure, or
on-premises at an organization's worksite.</p>

<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>Designing the deployment of code and features is important to the
beginning, middle, and end of an implementation. When you consider these
concepts at the beginning of an implementation, it carries forward into
post go-live activities and can set up the entire project for success.
By designing patterns and practices for deploying code changes and
knowing the post-deployment activities, or tasks, needed for each
project, you will find it easier to make decisions and have knowledge of your environments for the best implementation experience.</p>
<p>By the end of this module, you will be able to identify and describe
code deployment processes and strategies by validating that they are a
fit for specific company requirements during the implementation of
finance and operations apps.</p>

<h1 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">Identify relevant business concepts</h1>
<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>When identifying business concepts that are relevant for building the design documentation for implementation, you need to consider a few important concepts that affect projects more often, such as the potential architecture and needs of the implementation.</p>
<p>You'll need to consider changes to the out-of-the-box system that
is required for business processes, the size of the company and transactions
throughout the year, seasonality and when your company is most active,
and other information that is relevant to the business, and
expectations.</p>
<p>It is important to be honest about numbers, possibilities,
and information in this phase of the process because it will
set you up for success. You are there to guide the business through the
licenses, subscriptions, and technical requirements that they will need
for the present and future.</p>
<p>Additional items to consider for development and design:</p>
<ul>
<li>Projected go-live date</li>
<li>Number of vendors, customers, users, and so on</li>
<li>Existing network requirements and architecture</li>
<li>Industry standards</li>
<li>Technical competency of client resources</li>
</ul>

<h1 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">Evaluate functional specifications and create technical design documentation</h1>
<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>To understand the requirements for developing customizations for your implementation, you need to address the effects of implementing a new feature and how it might affect current functionality. You need to understand
existing processes and compare how you'll need to implement them in
the new system.</p>
<p><img alt="Diagram of potential effects implementing features." data-linktype="relative-path" src="./rawmb500/media_effects.png"/></p>
<p>These processes shouldn't be about the business requirements, but rather, be centered on the current state and how enhancements or changes will affect the overall system during the implementation. To design a new functional process, determine the needs and make sure that you know the step-by-step process to complete this development.</p>
<p>For example, if you have procurement processes that you want to automate
and don't currently use, you need to consider this new feature with the current state of the project and how it affects the other aspects of the system.</p>
<p>When you design the documentation for the functional specifications, the
more detailed the specifications are, the better idea you'll have of
the effort involved for the customizations and development.</p>

<h1 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">Identify the technical gaps</h1>
<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>The ability to understand the gaps in functionality between the old and
new systems is important for planning the design, to help determine new functionality and establish how and when it can be deployed.</p>
<p>For example, if the business creates and posts many sales orders, and the process that is currently in use requires extensive
functionality changes within Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, you must determine if you want to keep the same process or make
modifications to it. When that has been determined, you can focus on
whether it might be more pertinent to discuss how the system
functions out of the box and how a few changes can enhance the process
instead of conforming to dated and inefficient practices. In other
situations, it might be worth it to expend the effort and make more
customizations to the system for the previous process if it will enhance
the overall workflow.</p>
<p>When considering desired functionality, you should keep in mind the level of effort that is needed and the timeline of the project to ensure that the overall implementation is considered.</p>
<h2 id="identify-the-development-requirements-for-the-solution">Identify the development requirements for the solution</h2>
<p>After you have determined the gaps between the current and desired
functionality and the new features that are to be implemented, it is
important to identify the specific development requirements for each of
the solutions. You will need to address and understand the impacts of
each solution as you identify the requirements to ensure quality
planning and a smooth implementation.</p>

<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>The ability to describe and identify appropriate design patterns and
practices for code deployments is beneficial to every project and will
set up the project for success with features and production support.</p>
<h2 id="branching-strategies">Branching strategies</h2>
<p>The idea for branching strategies is to get your configuration to create a good flow of code to production but to also enable you to work on multiple code projects at once.</p>
<p>Keeping your branching structure as simple as possible is imperative in helping to avoid over-complicating it unnecessarily. You’ll want to expand the strategy only as needed. You may need to have a more complex branching strategy if the implementation has a lot of customizations.</p>
<p>Generally, you will want to start with at least a three-branch strategy: one for development, one for testing, and one for releasing your code
to the production instance.</p>
<p><img alt="Diagram of a three branch branching strategy." data-linktype="relative-path" src="./rawmb500/media_branching.png"/></p>
<p>Each of the code branches will relate to
one or more environments in your implementation. For more complicated
branching strategies and different approaches or management strategies, see the reference links at the end of this module.</p>
<h2 id="code-deployment-flows">Code deployment flows</h2>
<p>Code deployment flows, while connected to the branches that the code is
built from, differ slightly depending on a few factors. You will want to
take into consideration what the code is used for. For example, perhaps the code needed to move to production as soon as possible to fix an error. Perhaps the code is needed for additional functionality that is not important for the immediate future. These are some considerations that will help you determine where to deploy your code.</p>
<p>In general, you'll want to move the code in environments, that is,
from development environments where it has been verified to a testing
environment where multiple users can run through the process that you have modified. After the code has been tested, you will want to move it to a release or staging environment that will prepare it to be moved to
production. In finance and operations apps, the code will need to be deployed
into a Tier 2 Standard and Acceptance Test environment, and then selected as a release candidate before it can be promoted to the production
environment to ensure that it has been validated.</p>
<p>In the branching and code flow strategies that you develop, you
will need to remember that these can change throughout the
implementation, but planning for the changes is imperative to keeping
the end goal of the implementation in mind.</p>

<h1 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">The process for deploying code changes</h1>
<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>Understanding the process of code deployment is essential to
communication between technical and functional teams. Now that you have
learned about the flow of code, you will need to know how to deploy the
code to different environments to ensure that the flow is correct. Let's review the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>After you have checked in code to the development branch, from your development environment, you will need to merge it to the testing branch. Check the reference links at the end of this module for more details on this exact process.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When the code has been merged into the testing branch, you will build the code in the corresponding Visual Studio DevOps pipeline. That process creates a .zip file that you will upload to the asset library and apply to an environment. To apply to an environment, make sure that you have uploaded the file into the asset library by going there in the Lifecycle Services project. Select the <strong>Software deployable package</strong> on the left. After the page has loaded, select the <strong>+</strong> (plus) button to name and select the file from Azure DevOps.</p>
</li>
<li><p>After the package is in the asset library, go to the environment's full detail page for which you want to deploy the package. To deploy the code, select <strong>Maintain &gt; Apply updates</strong> and apply the correct code package.</p>
</li>
<li><p>After you deploy code to an environment, there's an essential task to complete.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the code completed, you need to go back to the <strong>Full details</strong> page of the environment, select <strong>History &gt; Environment changes</strong>, and then select the package that completed. Then, you can select <strong>Sign off</strong>. This process ensures that the package is complete, but you can also select the software deployable package as a release candidate for production if the package was applied to a Tier 2 Sandbox Acceptance Test environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the environment that you deployed the code to was a testing environment, restart the process at the merge step for the next branch  and deploy to the next environment in your flow.</p>
</li>

<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>It's important to understand the customization concepts of finance and operations apps and to master the skills to make those
customizations. With finance and operations apps, you can use the Task recorder
and Business process modeler tools to create user acceptance test
libraries. Additionally, you should also
know how to use the Data management framework.</p>
<h2 id="task-recorder">Task recorder</h2>
<p>Use the Task recorder tool to create multiple, in-depth, instructional
recordings of business processes in finance and operations apps that you
can use in various scenarios. For example, if you have a business user, go
through the process of creating a purchase order (PO). Then, upload that process into the asset library so that you can use it for training other resources. Use the recording with the Regression suite automation tool (RSAT) for regression testing scenarios and to share with other business users to ensure continuity across roles in the system.</p>
<h2 id="business-process-modeler">Business process modeler</h2>
<p>Use the Business process modeler tool to create user acceptance test libraries. You can create, view, and modify repeatable implementations that are based on libraries and flowcharts. Business process modeler helps you align the business processes for finance and operations apps with industry standard processes. Additionally, you can perform a fit-gap analysis between your business requirements and the default processes in the system, which helps you discover the development requirements.</p>
<h2 id="data-management-framework">Data management framework</h2>
<p>Use the Data management framework to manage data entity packages
in finance and operations apps. It uses a series of concepts to help you
set up and copy the configuration for new implementations. This feature is beneficial,
even if your team doesn't understand the structure of data or
dependencies, and it can lead to an easier implementation.</p>
<p>You can use all three frameworks to enhance implementations
from beginning to end, and you can use them in tandem to create an easier
step-by-step implementation strategy.</p>
<h2 id="implement-the-sysoperation-framework">Implement the SysOperation framework</h2>
<p>The SysOperation framework replaces the older RunBase framework, and it provides more extensibility. Both frameworks support the following capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parameters</li>
<li>Dialog user interface (UI)</li>
<li>Batch servers</li>
<li>Running operations interactively</li>
</ul>
<p>For finance and operations apps, we recommend that you use the SysOperation framework instead of the RunBase framework. Use SysOperation framework when a job should process or calculate something.</p>
<p>SysOperation consists of four main elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data contract class</li>
<li>Controller class</li>
<li>Service classUI</li>
<li>Builder class</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="data-contract-class">Data contract class</h3>
<p>The Data contract class indicates the attributes that are needed for the job, and the attributes automatically provide a dialog-based UI. The following code sample illustrates the Data contract class:</p>
<pre>
[DataContractAttribute]
internal final class MySysOperationContract
{
    private ItemId      itemId;

    [DataMember, SysOperationLabel(literalStr("Item Id")), SysOperationHelpText(literalStr("Item Id help")), SysOperationDisplayOrder('1')]
    public ItemId parmItemId(ItemId _itemId = itemId)
    {
        itemId = _itemId;

        return itemId;
    }
}
</pre>
<h3 id="controller-class">Controller class</h3>
<p>The Controller class is the execution class, which contains information about the dialog, execution mode, progress bar, and other elements. The following code sample illustrates the Controller class:</p>
<pre>
internal final class MySysOperationController extends SysOperationServiceController
{
    protected void new()
    {
        super(classStr(mySysOperationService), methodStr(MySysOperationService, process), SysOperationExecutionMode::Synchronous);
    }

    public ClassDescription defaultCaption()
    {
        return "My process job";
    }

    public static MySysOperationController construct(SysOperationExecutionMode _executionMode = SysOperationExecutionMode::Synchronous)
    {
        MySysOperationController controller;
        controller = new MySysOperationController();
        controller.parmExecutionMode(_executionMode);

        return controller;
    }

    public static void main(Args _args)
    {
        MySysOperationController controller;

        controller = MySysOperationController::construct();
        controller.parmArgs(_args);
        controller.startOperation();
    }
}
</pre>
<h3 id="service-class">Service class</h3>
<p>The Service class is the actual code that's processed or calculated. The following sample code illustrates the Service class:</p>
<pre>
internal final class MySysOperationService extends SysOperationServiceBase
{
    public void process(MySysOperationContract _contract)
    {
        // do something

        ItemId itemId = _contract.parmItemId();

        Info(strFmt("%1", itemId));
    }
}
</pre>
<h3 id="ui-builder-class">UI Builder class</h3>
<p>The UI Builder class is only needed if the UI requires modification from the dynamically generated UI or if it has custom behavior.</p>
<h2 id="implement-the-sysextensionserializer">Implement the SysExtensionSerializer</h2>
<p>You can add fields to a table by using an extension. If you're adding more than 10 fields to a table extension, the compiler throws the best practice error. We recommend that you use the alternative way of creating a new table and adding a foreign key relation to the standard table. Maps are available to help you improve a developer’s processes. The <strong>SysExtensionSerializerMap</strong> and <strong>SysExtensionSerializerExtensionMap</strong> maps make the create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations automated to the custom table.</p>
<p>You can create a new table for your new fields, as the following image depicts.</p>
<p><a data-linktype="relative-path" href="media/sysextensionserializer-map.png#lightbox"><img alt="Screenshot of the My Cust Table showing the Sys Extension Serializer Map." data-linktype="relative-path" src="./rawmb500/media_sysextensionserializer_map.png"/></a></p>
<p>Consider the following details about implementing the <strong>SysExtensionSerializer</strong> extension:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>CustTable</strong> field is an int64 (RecId).</p>
</li>
<li><p>It creates relation to the <strong>CustTable</strong> standard table and points to RecId on CustTable, as the following screenshot shows.</p>
<p><a data-linktype="relative-path" href="media/relation-standard-table.png#lightbox"><img alt="Screenshot of the Properties form showing the relation to the standard table." data-linktype="relative-path" src="./rawmb500/media_relation_standard_table.png"/></a></p>
</li>
<li><p>It creates mapping to map the <strong>SysExtensionSerializerExtensionMap</strong> field <strong>BaseRecId</strong> to a new table called <strong>MyCustTable</strong> and the <strong>CustTable</strong> field.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It creates an alternate key (Index) on the table for the <strong>CustTable</strong> field in the <strong>MyCustTable</strong> table. For the table property, the <strong>Replacement Key</strong> is set to the <strong>Alternate key</strong>, as the following screenshot shows.</p>
<p><a data-linktype="relative-path" href="media/alternate-key.png#lightbox"><img alt="Screenshot of the Properties form showing that the Replacement Key is set to the Alternate key." data-linktype="relative-path" src="./rawmb500/media_alternate_key.png"/></a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>SysExtensionSerializerMap</strong> contains methods for automatically inserting, updating, and performing many other functions. The standard <strong>CustTable</strong> table includes calls to the <strong>SysExtensionSerializer</strong> framework, which means that whenever a record in <strong>CustTable</strong> is updated, your table is also updated, as the following screenshot shows.</p>
<p><a data-linktype="relative-path" href="media/custtable-update.png#lightbox"><img alt="Screenshot showing the Cust Table." data-linktype="relative-path" src="./rawmb500/media_custtable_update.png"/></a></p>
<p>Using the <strong>SysExtensionSerializer</strong> framework fields helps you add a related table by following best practices and enabling CRUD functionality.</p>

<p>The design of branching strategies, code deployments, and consideration
of frameworks can be useful in determining a successful
implementation of finance and operations apps. To ensure that your
implementation is smooth, be sure to understand the concepts and needs
of your company, identify gaps, and create meaningful development
documentation.</p>

<p>Lifecycle Services is your hub for environment management in the
cloud. Environment creation, updates, code deployments, and database refresh all take place within Lifecycle Services. Additionally, Lifecycle Services allows you to stop and start key services without having to open a remote desktop protocol (RDP) session.</p>
<p>This module will discuss the tools and functionality that are available in Lifecycle Services that are important to finance and operations apps development.</p>

<h1 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">Perform support tasks</h1>
<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>Lifecycle Services offers several features to help you support the environments that
you're managing. From the <strong>Full details</strong> page of any environment, you
can restart key services, see changes that have been applied to the
environment, and access the back and front ends of the environment.</p>
<p><a data-linktype="relative-path" href="media/dashboard-1.png#lightbox"><img alt="Screenshot of the Lifecycle Services dashboard." data-linktype="relative-path" src="./rawmb500/media_dashboard_1.png"/></a></p>
<p>From the main menu, on the <strong>Full details</strong> page of any environment in
Lifecycle Services, select <strong>History</strong>, and then select <strong>Environment Changes</strong> from
the drop-down menu. The resulting page shows you every package that has
been applied from the Asset library to the environment, be that a
platform update, a code package, or a database maintenance task.</p>
<p>To apply code or updates to an environment, select <strong>Apply Updates</strong>
under the <strong>Maintain</strong> menu on the <strong>Full details</strong> page, and then
choose the relevant package from the list and select <strong>Apply</strong>.</p>
<p>For environments Tier 2 and up, the <strong>Move database</strong> option is also
available under the <strong>Maintain</strong> menu. This option allows you to export
a backup of the environment's database to the Asset library, import a
backup from the Asset library, or refresh the environment's database
directly from another Tier 2 environment. All processes run
automatically when they are queued to ensure repeatability and
reliability.</p>
<p>Another option that is available in environments Tier 2 and up is Restart
services, which allows you to remotely restart IIS, Batch, the Lifecycle Services
Diagnostic service, DIXF, or the Reporting server.</p>
<h2 id="additional-support">Additional support</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can get additional support in Lifecycle Services for finance and operations apps.</p>
<h3 id="dynamics-365-community">Dynamics 365 Community</h3>
<p>The Dynamics 365 Community is where you can engage with experts and peers that work with and use Dynamics 365 applications. Here you can read forums, blogs, access webinars, videos and find useful events. To get started using the Dynamics 365 Community, go to <a data-linktype="external" href="https://community.dynamics.com/?azure-portal=true">Welcome to Dynamics 365 Community</a> and log in with your Microsoft, work, or school account. You can explore the content with or without signing in. If you would like to post a question, comment, or receive email notifications, you will need to sign in.</p>
<h3 id="issue-search">Issue search</h3>
<p>In Lifecycle Services, you can use the Issue search tool to quickly search for Microsoft Knowledge Base (KB) articles, hotfixes, workarounds, and reported issues. Within the Issue search tool, you can also review current issues that are in process of being fixed for a specific functional area of Dynamics 365 finance and operations apps, and fixed issues.</p>
<p><a data-linktype="relative-path" href="media/issue-search-ss.png#lightbox"><img alt="An example of the current issues in the Issue search tool." data-linktype="relative-path" src="./rawmb500/media_issue_search_ss.png"/></a></p>
<p>To access and use the Issue search tool, open your project in Lifecycle Services, then select the <strong>Issue search</strong> tile. Here, you can search for an issue. Once you have typed a query, you will be able to search through any related content. To view information about the status of Lifecycle Services Issue search content, go to <a data-linktype="absolute-path" href="/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/issue-search-lcs/?azure-portal=true">Issue search in Lifecycle Services</a>.</p>

<p>The table of cloud-hosted environments on the <strong>Cloud-hosted
environments</strong> page of a project has an <strong>Add</strong> button that you can select to deploy
new environments.</p>
<p><a data-linktype="relative-path" href="media/cloud-1.png#lightbox"> <img alt=" Screenshot of the Cloud-hosted environments page." data-linktype="relative-path" src="./rawmb500/media_cloud_1.png"/> </a></p>
<p>When you select the name, application version,
platform version, and purpose of the environment that you want to deploy,
you should consider changing a few key settings:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>VM type</strong> - Depends on your client's needs.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Machine name</strong> - Makes your RDP window headers more
human-readable than a GUID.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Data</strong> - If you don't want demo data, make sure that <strong>None</strong> is
selected.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can create, maintain, and delete cloud-hosted environments by using Lifecycle Services tools and components. Typically, you create a Lifecycle Service implementation project to host all cloud-hosted environments for a project. You can create cloud-hosted environments in Microsoft Azure with the Azure connector settings.</p>
<h2 id="configure-the-azure-connector">Configure the Azure connector</h2>
<p>To create cloud-hosted environments in Azure, use the configuration from Azure connector in Lifecycle Services. The first time that you configure settings for cloud-hosted environments, the system prompts you to configure the Azure connector. Then, it guides you to the Lifecycle Services project settings for Azure connectors.</p>
<p>A requirement for Azure connectors is that you must use an Azure subscription that’s a contributor for Dynamics Deployment Services. Then, you need to allow Lifecycle Services to use the Azure subscription. You can assign the contributor role for Dynamics Deployment Services by using Azure identity and access management (IAM) for the subscription in the Azure portal.</p>
<p>To configure the Azure connector, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Add</strong> in project settings for Azure connectors to configure the requirement that allows you to create a new Azure connector in Lifecycle Services. A prompt for Microsoft Azure setup appears in Lifecycle Services.</li>
<li>Complete the <strong>Name</strong>, <strong>Azure subscription ID</strong>, and <strong>Azure subscription Microsoft Entra ID Tenant Domain (or ID)</strong> fields.</li>
<li>Lifecycle Services attempts to validate the Dynamics Deployment Services role and authorization. If validation is successful, you must select an Azure region that you plan to use for creating the cloud-hosted environment. If you select <strong>Connect</strong>, the system creates the new Azure connector.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can have more Azure connectors in Lifecycle Services, but one is always the default.</p>
<h2 id="configure-azure-devops">Configure Azure DevOps</h2>
<p>You can configure Microsoft Azure DevOps in the project settings in your Lifecycle Services project. You must configure this feature so that you can create a build pipeline when deploying a build and test environment.</p>
<p>Configuring Azure DevOps requires that you enter a URL for your organization in Azure DevOps and then select a DevOps project.</p>
<h2 id="create-a-cloud-hosted-environment">Create a cloud-hosted environment</h2>
<p>When you configure an Azure connector as a requirement for cloud-hosted environments, you can create environments.
To do so, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Cloud-hosted environments</strong> menu, select <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the application version and platform for the cloud-hosted environment. Then, select your environment topology:
<ul>
<li><strong>DEMO</strong> - The system deploys an environment for demo purposes.</li>
<li><strong>DEVTEST</strong> - Two options are available:
<ul>
<li><strong>Build and test</strong> - The system deploys an environment for build and test. If your Azure DevOps is configurated for your Lifecycle Services project, the system creates a build pipeline in Azure DevOps by using this environment.</li>
<li><strong>Development</strong> - The system deploys an environment for development.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Configure an environment name, the size of your environment, and various <strong>Advanced</strong> settings:
<ul>
<li><strong>Environment name</strong> - Enter a logical name, depending on your company’s naming standard.</li>
<li><strong>Size</strong> - Virtual machine sizes vary in price and performance. Select the option based on your specific requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced settings</strong> - Configure these settings as needed according to your project requirements:
<ul>
<li><strong>Customize SQL Database Configuration</strong> - Specify that a database with demo data deploys in your environment.</li>
<li><strong>Disk</strong> - Select disk space, premium storage, and type of storage. Costs vary depending on your selection.</li>
<li><strong>Customize virtual machine names</strong> - Specify name preferences.</li>
<li><strong>Power Platform Integration</strong> - Configure Microsoft Power Platform integration.
<div class="NOTE">
<p>Note</p>
<p>With tier 1 environments, you must complete this configuration during deployment, and you can’t change it after creation.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><strong>Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations</strong> - Select whether to publish the home page.</li>
<li><strong>Customize virtual network</strong> - Select whether to use a new or existing virtual network.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Select <strong>Next</strong> when you complete all configurations. The system should create your new environment. The environment creation can take a while (four to six hours). Your new cloud-hosted environment should have a status of <strong>Queued</strong> in the cloud-hosted environment list until it deploys. The <strong>Deployment</strong> status changes to <strong>Deploying</strong> during creation.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="update-a-cloud-hosted-environment">Update a cloud-hosted environment</h2>
<p>You can update cloud-hosted environments to a new application and platform version by configuring details for the environment. To do so, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>View available updates from the <strong>Full details in the cloud hosted environment</strong> list.</li>
<li>Maintain your current environment configuration by selecting <strong>Maintain</strong> and <strong>Apply</strong> update options for the selected cloud-hosted environment. The <strong>Apply updates</strong> option lists all updates in the Lifecycle Services project Asset library.</li>
<li>Import updates from the global Asset library to your project’s Asset library by selecting <strong>Import</strong>, selecting the update, and then selecting <strong>Pick</strong>.</li>
<li>Select and confirm the software deployable package that you want to apply. The deployment status should change to <strong>Queued</strong> and then change to <strong>Servicing</strong> as the update proceeds.</li>
</ol>
<p>After your environment updates, the deployment status changes from <strong>Servicing</strong> to <strong>Deployed</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="start-and-stop-a-cloud-hosted-environment">Start and stop a cloud-hosted environment</h2>
<p>From the cloud-hosted environment list, you can start or stop an environment by following these processes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start an environment by selecting it and then selecting <strong>Start</strong>. The deployment status changes to <strong>Starting</strong> and then changes to <strong>Deployed</strong>. Then, your environment is accessible.</li>
<li>If an environment’s deployment status is <strong>Deployed</strong>, you can stop it by selecting the environment in the cloud-hosted environment list and then selecting <strong>Stop</strong>. The deployment status changes to <strong>Stopping</strong> and then <strong>Stopped</strong>.</li>
<li>Delete a stopped environment by selecting it and then select <strong>Deallocate</strong>. Deallocation prepares the environment for deletion, and then you can delete it.</li>
</ul>

<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>The asset library is divided into many categories that contain
different kinds of files. Some of the types of files that you are most likely to use include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BPM artifact</strong> - Documents pertaining to the Business process model (BPM).</li>
<li><strong>Database backup</strong> - Files that you can use to restore an SQL or Azure SQL database.</li>
<li><strong>Model</strong> - Prepackaged extensions that you can install on an    environment.</li>
<li><strong>Software deployable package</strong> - Packages that you built from Azure  DevOps of code that was developed in Visual Studio.</li>
</ul>

<p>The asset library can grow in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use the <strong>Import</strong> button to bring in files that are
published by Microsoft or Independent Software Vendors (ISVs). This
opens a table that you can filter for the package you need. When you find the correct package, select it and confirm your import.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add files to the asset library by uploading files
from your computer by using the <strong>Add</strong> button. Enter a name and
description for your asset and select <strong>Upload File</strong>, which will take you to another screen. Select <strong>Browse</strong> to open a File Explorer window, which you can use to locate the file. When you've made your  selection, use the <strong>Upload</strong> button to add the file to your asset.
With your asset complete, confirm it to add it to the library.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The asset library also has a <strong>Delete</strong> button that lets you remove
items and an <strong>Edit</strong> button for modifying the name and description of
assets.</p>

<h1 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">Manage the code update process</h1>
<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>When you update the version of a finance and operations apps environment, your existing code might not always work as intended with the new application version.</p>
<p>The following best practices will help you navigate your custom code extensions during the update process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a code branch for development. As you continue to update, you'll need to update your custom code to be compatible with the update’s changes. Promote from this branch to a test branch to confirm that changes work as you update your environments. Do a local, full build on a cloud-hosted, development environment that has been updated to the latest version to see all Best Practice warnings and errors that need to be addressed before updating other environments. Redeploy other, non-development cloud-hosted environment topologies on the new version rather than updating in place.</li>
<li>Deploy the update to your Tier 2 environments, then your custom code package with all changes promoted from the Development environment. Test the application and custom code in the Tier 2 environment and address any resulting issues. This process will ensure no errors exist with custom code after the deployment of updates in your environments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, when making code changes, to ensure that you are developing in a custom extension model. Having a custom model where you create extensions of existing Microsoft objects will automatically rename the extension file type to avoid compatibility issues with Microsoft code and objects that might change during an update.</p>

<p>In finance and operations apps, you run your instances on
cloud environments, which require performance monitoring. Your Lifecycle
Services implementation has plenty of usable tools that help you
monitor and keep track of overall system health for every environment.
These tools help you observe anything that might affect your
server's performance. It is important to monitor this on a regular basis
to ensure that nothing is changing and everything looks healthy.</p>

<h1 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">Diagnose performance issues by using Trace parser</h1>
<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>By using Trace parser, you can consume traces, and analyze
performance in your finance and operations apps deployment. This ensures that you have an idea of what is currently happening in your deployed
environments and helps ensure that business users have the response time that they need for their daily processes.</p>
<p>This unit explores how to use the Trace parser to identify any current issues that are deployed in finance and operations apps environments.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-trace-parser">How to use Trace parser</h2>
<p>Trace parser is available in the <strong>PerfSDK</strong> folder on your
development environment deployments. When you have located the tool and
installed it in your development environment, you can create traces by
performing the actions that you want to analyze.</p>
<p>To capture a trace, you must first ensure that you have completed the list of tasks that you need to analyze to avoid having metadata and other
tasks included in your trace. You must also add the System tracing user
role to the user who needs to complete the trace. In the finance and operations user interface, go to <strong>System administration &gt; Users &gt;
Users</strong>. From there, you can select the user and select <strong>Assign roles</strong>
on the <strong>User's roles</strong> FastTab.</p>
<p>After you have added the System tracing user role, the assigned user can capture the trace. In the navigation bar at the top-right of the screen, select the question mark icon. In the drop-down menu that appears, select <strong>Trace</strong>. When the new screen appears, name the trace that you are going to capture and select <strong>Start trace</strong>. Perform all the actions that you need to capture and analyze before selecting <strong>Stop trace</strong>.</p>
<p>When you stop the trace, you can select <strong>Download trace</strong>, which stores the captured trace on your local machine, where you can analyze it
with the desktop version of Trace parser; however, it cannot be uploaded
later. If you choose <strong>Upload trace</strong>, Trace parser stores the trace in the cloud to download at a different time, but it is automatically deleted after seven days. Alternatively, the trace can be manually deleted from the <strong>Captured traces</strong> page.</p>
<div class="TIP">
<p>Tip</p>
<p>If your sequence of events for a trace takes more than a few minutes, we recommend that you take multiple, smaller traces to minimize the risk of losing data if the trace becomes too large to analyze in a timely manner.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="diagnose-issues-and-analyze-performance-by-using-trace-parser">Diagnose issues and analyze performance by using Trace parser</h2>
<p>By using Trace Parser, you can identify performance issues. Some of these performance issues may include long-running X++ methods, time-consuming SQL queries, or client server calls.</p>
<p>The captured trace can be opened to diagnose issues and analyze
performance of the tasks in multiple ways. The next step after
downloading the trace file is to open the Trace parser on your developer
environment or VHD. Trace parser is installed by default and is located in C:\Program Files (x86)\MicrosoftDynamicsAX\Microsoft.Dynamics.AX.Tracing.TraceParser.exe.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<p>Note</p>
<p>Trace parser is only available on DevTest topology deployed environments, it is not available in Demo topology environments.</p>
</div>
<p>In the Trace parser, you can download and import the previously captured events. To do this, select the <strong>Download and import</strong> button in
the Trace parser to import the ETL file.</p>
<p>To view the traces and analyze them, select the <strong>Timeline</strong> tab to see
the timeline view. You can use the <strong>Select Grouping</strong> drop-down menu to
group content that is based on a variety of categories and event types, such as Customer ID, username, Session name, and so on. The groupings display timestamps of each event, total number of events, and the lowest event level in the grouping. You can also see the list of all events in a threaded or unthreaded view. Go to the <strong>Property</strong> grid for a selected event to see a timeline chart for all the selected events, filter events, and session analysis notes. In the <strong>Call tree</strong> view,
under the <strong>Call tree</strong> tab, you find the call tree for all X++
methods for the captured events. Additionally, on the <strong>X++</strong> tab is a list of all the X++ methods, and you can sort them by fields such as inclusive/exclusive durations, RPC, or database calls.</p>
<h2 id="scenario">Scenario:</h2>
<p>Contoso USA users are experiencing performance issues when they try to post a payment journal. The time it takes for the journal to post is taking much longer than it should. As a developer for Contoso USA, you have been tasked to diagnose why posting payment journals is taking so long.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to investigate the performance issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in to finance and operations apps and start a trace from the <strong>Help and support</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Name the trace.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Start</strong>.</li>
<li>Perform the business operation that you are diagnosing. In this case, you would post a payment journal.</li>
<li>Stop the trace.</li>
<li>Download the trace. It is important to keep in mind that when the trace is downloaded, it is deleted.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Upload trace</strong>. You should receive a message in the Action center that the trace is uploaded.</li>
<li>Return to the <strong>Tracing</strong> main menu</li>
<li>Select <strong>Captured traces</strong>. The captured traces page opens with the trace you captured.</li>
<li>Now you can launch Trace Parser, import the trace, and analyze.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before you can analyze a trace, you need to download the Trace Parser. To download the trace parser application, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In your developer virtual machine, open File Explorer.</li>
<li>Find the Trace Parser .exe file. In most Tier 1 boxes, the download can be found in E:\AppRing3\10.0.8.10012\retail\Services\PerfSDK\Scripts.</li>
<li>When Trace Parser is downloaded, start it.</li>
<li>Register the database. To do this, specify the server name, and then name the database. See the following example:</li>
<li>Select <strong>Register</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Yes</strong> when you are asked if you want to create the database.</li>

<h1 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">Load testing by using the Performance SDK</h1>
<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>A performance load test is performed when you need to test the
environment under normal, real-life load conditions. This will help the
system adjust and see how it runs under normal conditions of single or
multiple users. By the end of this unit, you will be able to run a load
test that will test performance under real-life load conditions. This
testing ensures that the code and business processes run as expected
with no errors under conditions such as when the environments are used by
all business users, in a normal manner, throughout the day. Some processes need to be tested under additional load testing conditions to make sure that the multi-user environment will not cause issues for any of your business processes.</p>
<h2 id="run-a-single-user-performance-test-with-the-performance-sdk">Run a single user performance test with the Performance SDK</h2>
<p>To start a performance test, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a task recording of a business process. When the recording is saved as a developer recording, and the XML file is downloaded, you need to configure your development environment. The development environment setup requires the downloading of zip files, adding folders into the PerfSDK library, and configuring files.</li>
<li>Generate a C# performance test from the task recorder file that you  downloaded in Visual Studio. You will need to add references to specific DLLs and create new C# classes for the task recorder.</li>
<li>When the setup is completed, you will be able to run the single user testing in the <strong>Test Explorer</strong> through Visual Studio. Be sure to run your business process's end-to-end scenario first before you capture it to avoid slow or additional tasks while you are recording.</li>
<li>When you record your scenario in the task recorder, enter values  manually instead of selecting them from the drop-down lists to ensure that the tests can create data.</li>
<li>Replay your task recording before downloading it to make sure that every step was recorded. Restart Visual Studio if you don't see your  test case after the solution has been built.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="set-up-azure-devops-for-multi-user-testing">Set up Azure DevOps for multi-user testing</h2>
<p>Before running a multi-user performance test, you need to verify several
prerequisites on your environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio Enterprise Edition will need to be in the development environment that you are using.</li>
<li>You need to have a tier-2 or above sandbox environment on the same application and platform update as your development environment.</li>
<li>You cannot proceed with multi-user testing without performing a single user test or having the C# testing classes generated for end-to-end scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<p>After you have verified that these prerequisites are performed, you can proceed to configure the finance and operations apps development environment. This requires downloading and configuring several certificates in the
environment. Then, you can prepare the 
PerfSDKSample
 solution for
the multi-user testing by installing, configuring the 
.config file
, and running tests.</p>
<p>When the development environment has been properly configured, the
tier-2 or above sandbox must be prepared for multi-user testing. This
process includes installing the same certificates that were created for
the development environment on the tier-2 or above sandbox for all Application Object Servers (AOS) and ensuring that the users are created in the system.</p>
<h2 id="create-and-run-a-multi-user-performance-test-from-a-single-user-test">Create and run a multi-user performance test from a single user test</h2>
<p>To create and run a multi-user performance test, the preparation must be
complete. After completing the preparation, you need to go back to the development environment that you prepared and run the load test through Visual Studio. This step will launch the test and you will be able review the output in the Visual Studio interface to diagnose any performance issues that you might have.</p>

Most queries are run synchronously to ensure that the results are returned instantaneously. If you're having performance issues, the query runs could cause a time-out    error. If this happens, select the option to turn off <strong>Use Fast Query</strong>    and rerun the query.</li>
<li><strong>Actions</strong> - Shows a list of predefined actions that you should use    to mitigate issues in sandbox and production environments. These    actions include adding or dropping an index, updating statistics on a table, rebuilding indices, terminating a blocking statement, and others. You can view environment history based on the action that was performed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="advanced-troubleshooting-with-sql-insights">Advanced troubleshooting with SQL Insights</h2>
<p>For advanced troubleshooting, you can view the raw information logs.
Before exporting the logs, you can use predefined queries to get the raw
logs for an issue to aid in your diagnostics and monitoring. The different types of predefined queries include slow queries,
deadlocks, crashes, and financial reporting issues.</p>
<p>In addition to raw logs, an advanced SQL troubleshooting tool enables performance analysis. These tools are similar to the DynPerf tool that is used in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012. If you want more information on this, check the reference links in the Summary unit of this module.</p>

<h1 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">Create a SQL trace by using the SQL Profiler</h1>
<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>Another tool developers can use to test performance and diagnose performance issues is the SQL Profiler. You access the Profiler through the SQL Server management studio. Here you can exploit the server-side trace capabilities of the SQL Server Profiler to export a trace definition that you can use to create a collection that uses the Generic SQL Trace collector type.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<p>Note</p>
<p>This tool can only be used on tier 1 Dynamics 365 instances</p>
</div>
<p>There are many reasons why you would want to use the SQL Profiler. For example, you may need to see all the long-running queries on the SQL server system, not just the long-running queries in finance and operations apps.</p>
<p>To access and use the SQL Profiler, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In SQL Server Management Studio, open <strong>SQL Server Profiler</strong> from the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Connect to the database.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Trace Properties</strong> windows, name your trace.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When you have specified all properties, select <strong>Run</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>While the SQL Profile trace is running, you perform the process or processes that are of concern.
For example, users may be experiencing slowness when adding data to the SalesTable. In this case, you will ask the user to perform the task, while the trace is running.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When the process is complete, stop the trace by selecting the <strong>Stop</strong> button in the menu.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now you can analyze the trace by reviewing the trace results. The following screenshot shows what the trace looks like when it is stopped.</p>

<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>Environment monitoring is a simple way to access current activity on
environments in your finance and operations apps implementation. By using the
<strong>Environment Monitoring</strong> and <strong>SQL Insights</strong> that come in a user-friendly dashboard, you can see measurements and diagnostics of
your environment's health. Within the <strong>Health metrics</strong> dashboard, some
issues are reported directly to the Microsoft Service Engineering Team
and some are mitigated immediately. If there are any concerns regarding
performance, this is a good way to gain insight into potential issues.
This unit examines how to view the health concerns for environments and determine how to mitigate many issues before they happen.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-health-checks-performed-with-health-metrics">Types of health checks performed with Health metrics</h2>
<p>Several types of health checks can be performed within the <strong>Health metrics</strong> interface, which you can use to make observations about your environment. The health checks span various services and components of the environments, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>AOS</li>
<li>Batch frameworks</li>
<li>Data Import/Export framework</li>
<li>Microsoft Azure SQL</li>
<li>Management reporter</li>
</ul>
<p>The checks are performed based on multiple data sources, like the
telemetry that is collected from the environments, the checks that are
done by a continuously monitoring watchdog service, CP counters, along
with other system-level counters that the environment produces. As previously mentioned, some health checks are reported to the Microsoft Service Engineering team for direct investigation.</p>
<h2 id="viewing-the-activity-log-and-the-user-load-in-the-activity-monitor">Viewing the activity log and the user load in the activity monitor</h2>
<p>On the <strong>Environment Monitoring</strong> page, select the <strong>Health metrics</strong>
tab to view the monitoring dashboard. Health metrics are collected for
all machines and components that relate to the environment that you selected in Lifecycle Services. The health metrics that you can view are CPU usage, available memory, errors logged per second, and batch heartbeat. You will be alerted about any abnormal activities in the metrics. Some alerts are taken care of by the system, but others will need you to take action to mitigate them.</p>
<p>The <strong>Activity</strong> tab contains several different charts and sections. The user interaction chart shows user activities on various
machines in the environment, as well as the SQL utilization trend. The
<strong>activity load</strong> section shows the various activities that were
performed on each machine, while the <strong>user load</strong> section shows all the
system users and the time that the user spent on a specific machine. If you hover over an activity in the activity load section, you can see an advanced look into the user's specific actions. You can also use filters on the page to narrow the information logs. Time duration, user, and search terms are only some of the filters that you can use to peer into the information for more comprehensive statistics. Note that the page doesn't load any data by default, and you must select a
time duration and then select <strong>Submit time</strong> for the data to show up.
The activity monitoring tool retains data for 30 days.</p>

<p>Version control serves two purposes in the development pipeline.</p>
<ul>
<li>As a platform for sharing code across multiple workstations, version control allows you to collaborate with other developers on projects and features.</li>
<li>The same features also help you to separate stable code from code that is still under development.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the many version control technologies that are available, we recommend and support Azure Repos by using Team Foundation Version Control Services for use with finance and operations apps.</p>

<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>This unit explains how to configure Visual Studio to connect to
the Team Foundation Version Control Services in Azure DevOps.</p>
<p>When you have a project in Azure DevOps to host your repository, you are
ready to connect with Visual Studio to start developing. Everything you
need to interact with Azure DevOps is found under the <strong>Team</strong> heading
on the menu bar or in the <strong>Team Explorer</strong> window.</p>
<p><a data-linktype="relative-path" href="media/team-explorer.png#lightbox"><img alt="Screenshot of the Team explorer window view." data-linktype="relative-path" src="./rawmb500/media_team_explorer.png"/></a></p>
<p>To connect to an Azure DevOps project from Visual Studio, follow these
steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Manage Connections</strong> in the <strong>Team Explorer</strong> window or under the <strong>Team</strong> header on the menu bar. This option might appear simply as a green plug icon.</li>
<li>All the existing project connections from your local machine will be    available to select in the window that appears. Right-click and select <strong>Connect</strong> to make the connection.</li>
<li>In the window that opens in the <strong>Team Explorer</strong> window, select <strong>Manage Connections</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Connect to Team Project</strong>. This will open a new dialog box.</li>
<li>In the dialog box, select <strong>Servers</strong>.</li>
<li>This opens a new dialog box, where you will enter the Azure DevOps URL. If the URL looks like 
clientname.visualstudio.com
, and it usually does, the remaining fields will be automatically populated.</li>
<li>After you confirm these settings, a new dialog box will prompt you to sign in to Azure DevOps.</li>
<li>When you have signed in, select the box for the desired Azure DevOps     project on the <strong>Team Projects</strong> pane.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Connect</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Advanced Configuration</strong> to open a dialog box for adjusting the parameters of your workspace mapping.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Advanced</strong> in this dialog box for more options.</li>
<li>Change the workspace from a <strong>Private</strong> workspace to a <strong>Public</strong> workspace.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Working folders</strong> table, remove all existing mappings.</li>
<li>On a new row of the table, map the <strong>Projects</strong> folder of the    desired branch of your Azure DevOps project to your local user's    <strong>Projects</strong> folder for Visual Studio.</li>
<li>On another row in the table, map the <strong>Metadata</strong> folder of the same    branch of your Azure DevOps project to the <strong>Packages Local Directory</strong>    folder of the <strong>AOS Service</strong> drive.</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong>.</li>

<p>This unit explains how to check in code, merge code, resolve
conflicts, and roll back changes in Visual Studio.</p>
<h2 id="get-the-latest-version-and-check-in-code">Get the latest version and check in code</h2>
<p>When working with multiple developers or projects, you should validate
that your code includes the latest source control's version. To avoid
conflicts and ensure that the code is developed correctly, checking the
source is mandatory.</p>
<p>The Source Control Explorer is the view for all the code and objects that are checked into source control.</p>
<p>To open the Source Control Explorer, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Select <strong>View</strong> on the menu bar of Visual Studio.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the drop-down menu, select <strong>Other Windows</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>From the available options, select <strong>Source Control Explorer</strong>.</p>
<p><a data-linktype="relative-path" href="media/source-control-explorer.png#lightbox"><img alt="Screenshot of the Source Control Explorer view." data-linktype="relative-path" src="./rawmb500/media_source_control_explorer.png"/></a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To make sure that you are looking at the most recent checked-in version of
objects in the Source Control Explorer, right-click on the objects and
select <strong>Get Latest Version</strong>. Alternatively, you can do this at the folder level to
get all the updates.</p>
<p>You should always get the latest files from the branch that you are working in before checking in new changes. If someone else also pushes changes to the file that you are editing, this gives you an opportunity to reconcile your changes with theirs and make sure that all the features are working before the resulting changes are checked in.</p>
<p>To perform the check-in process, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Pending Changes</strong> from the <strong>Team Explorer</strong> window.</li>
<li>Enter a check-in comment.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Check In</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="merging-code-and-resolving-code-conflicts">Merging code and resolving code conflicts</h2>
<p>Sometimes, when you get the latest code from a branch into Visual
Studio, the code stored on the server has changes that are
different from the changes that you made locally. This is a merge conflict.</p>
<p>When Visual Studio encounters a merge conflict, it attempts to
resolve it automatically. Any such resolution is in the output log. If
any conflicts fail to resolve automatically, they appear in a new window that prompts you to tell Visual Studio what it
should do for each conflicting file.</p>
<p>The <strong>Resolve Conflicts</strong> window gives you the following options for
each file:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Take Source</strong> - Use the file that you pulled from source control,
erasing all your local changes.</li>
<li><strong>Keep Local</strong> - Keep your local file, losing any changes that are present in source control.</li>
<li><strong>Merge using Merge Tool</strong> - View both versions of the file
side by side, choosing to keep or discard each change in either
version, one at a time.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can't check in a changeset until there are no
unresolved merge conflicts, so mastering these tools is key to your
success as a member of a development team.</p>
<h2 id="roll-back-changes-in-visual-studio">Roll back changes in Visual Studio</h2>
<p>Everybody makes mistakes, and sometimes you need to roll back changes
that are checked into a source control branch.</p>
<p>In Visual Studio, this is simple to accomplish from the Source Control
Explorer. Right-click the branch that you want to roll back changes from
and select <strong>View History</strong>. This selection opens a new window, where you can see all the changesets that have been checked in to this branch. To roll back a changeset, right-click the changeset and select
<strong>Rollback Entire Changeset</strong>.</p>
<p><a data-linktype="relative-path" href="media/roll-back-changeset.png#lightbox"><img alt="Screenshot showing the Rollback Entire Changeset icon." data-linktype="relative-path" src="./rawmb500/media_roll_back_changeset.png"/></a></p>

<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>Code reviews, or having one or more other developers approve your changes
before you check them in, are a helpful practice in keeping your repository stable.</p>
<p>To submit code for review from Visual Studio, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>My Work</strong> in the <strong>Team Explorer</strong> window.</li>
<li>Make sure that all the changes you want to have reviewed are visible in the <strong>In Progress Work</strong> section.</li>
<li>In the <strong>In Progress Work</strong> section, select <strong>Request Review</strong>.</li>
<li>Enter any users that you would like to review your changes.</li>
<li>Enter a name and description for your changes.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Submit Request</strong>.</li>
<li>Optionally, you can name your shelveset and select <strong>Suspend</strong> so
that you can work on other changes while you wait for review.</li>
</ol>
<p>The code review appears in the <strong>Code Reviews</strong> section of <strong>My Work</strong>,
for you and for each of your reviewers.</p>
<p>To perform a code review, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click <strong>code review request</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Open</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Accept</strong> to let the requestor know that you have agreed to review their work.</li>
<li>Open each file in the shelveset and use the <strong>Difference</strong> window to see the changes side by side with the original file contents.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Team Explorer</strong> window, add any comments that you have to the relevant files. Comments link to a text selection, like in a Microsoft 365 document, so be aware of that when you add each new comment.</li>
<li>When you have reviewed each file, select <strong>Send Comments</strong> to let the reviewer know what changes you have recommended.</li>
<li>If you have no comments, select <strong>Close Review</strong> and indicate that the changes passed your review so that the reviewer knows to check them in.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you happen to make a mistake, perhaps your code reviewer will catch that mistake and send you one or more comments. To view and address these
comments, follow these steps:</p>

<p>Visual Studio integrates with Azure DevOps to help you to collaborate
with other developers and protect the integrity of your stable builds.</p>
<p>The integration of Visual Studio and Azure DevOps lets you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect an Azure DevOps project to finance and operations apps.</li>
<li>View, get, and roll back changes.</li>
<li>Resolve merge conflicts to avoid losing work.</li>
<li>Conduct code reviews to ensure that your source is the best it can    be.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bringing all these features together lets you, the developer, handle all your duties in one place. Mastering them will help your projects run smoothly and improve your ability to contribute to a development team.</p>

<h1 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">Introduction</h1>
<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>Finance and operations apps provide many tools that you can
use to test new code upgrades or customizations. As a developer, it's important that you use the test frameworks when designing changes to the code base. Not doing so introduces a level of risk every time the new system is used.</p>
<p>The test framework in finance and operations apps provides a structured approach to validate code functionality. By incorporating automated testing into your development process, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ensure code quality</strong> - Validate that your changes work as intended and align with business requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Detect regressions early</strong> - Identify issues introduced by code changes before they affect production environments.</li>
<li><strong>Improve deployment confidence</strong> - Prevent deployment of incomplete or problematic code into critical environments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the test framework helps streamline development and deployment cycles, ensuring a smoother experience for end-users.</p>

<h1 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">Unit test framework</h1>
<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>You can use the SysTest Framework to write
unit test code, integrate the tests, and then run the test to automate
code testing. You can set up the SysTest Framework to create unit test
from code. You can also import Task recorder recordings into Visual
Studio to generate test code. More information about the Task
recorder is provided later in this module.</p>
<p>Your test can then be integrated into a test module which can be used to
manage test code. Adding the test module
to the source control allows you to integrate your test with the
build process. This addition runs your test code during the build to verify that all functionality is working as expected.</p>
<p>You can also run the test code individually. Running test codes is a repeatable process so, when the test class is created, you can run it multiple times. These iterations allow you to continuously validate your code changes. Additionally, quickly running tests to validate if your functionality still works after another developer has modified the element is key for productivity.</p>
<p>The option to rerun tests can also be beneficial to your
organization's productivity during upgrades that are released by Microsoft. Instead of requiring user resources to regression test all the
functionality from the user interface, you can run these unit tests that
will enter the required data and run testing processes to determine if
functionality is performing as expected.</p>

<h1 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">Acceptance test library</h1>
<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>The Acceptance test library (ATL) is an X++ test library that allows
developers to create consistent test data. It makes test code more
readable, and methods that create test data become more easily
discovered. ATL also supports high performance of test cases. You can use
the classes within the ATL to create repeatable tests that will write
test data and run processes by using that data. This feature can simplify some of the more complicated data setup and processes that would be required testing through the user interface (UI).</p>
<p>When creating classes and methods in ATL, you must follow rigid
structuring and naming. Classes are grouped into the following concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Navigation</strong> - Discover entities and test data methods.</li>
<li><strong>Test data methods</strong> - These methods are used to set up test data.</li>
<li><strong>Entities</strong> - Represent data and associated behavior that is perceived as a single unit.</li>
<li><strong>Creators</strong> - Let you create specific test data.</li>
<li><strong>Commands</strong> - Run business operations.</li>
<li><strong>Queries</strong> - Find entities.</li>
<li><strong>Specifications</strong> - Describe expected entities at the end of the test.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ATL code generator quickly creates and updates new ATL entities,
queries, and specifications based on tables and data entities.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of the generate alt entity page." data-linktype="relative-path" src="./rawmb500/media_alt.png"/></p>
<p>The following steps help you create an ATL entity class by using the code
generation:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Visual Studio, open the table you want to use in the Designer window.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Addins</strong> menu, select <strong>Generate ATL Entity</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the fields that should be included in the ATL Entity class.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Rename the entity and fields as needed.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Generate</strong> to create the class.</li>
</ol>
<p>To create an ATL query class by using the wizard, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Visual Studio, open the table you want to use in the Designer window.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Addins</strong> menu, select <strong>Generate ATL Query</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the fields and relations that should be included in the ATL
Query class.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Rename the entity, fields, and the relations as needed.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Generate</strong> to create the class.</li>
</ol>
<p>To create an ATL Specification class by using the wizard, follow these
steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Visual Studio, open the table you want to use in the Designer window.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Addins</strong> menu, select <strong>Generate ATL Specification</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the fields that should be included in the ATL Specification
class.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Rename the specification and fields as needed.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Generate</strong> to create the class.</li>

<h1 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">Task recorder</h1>
<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>The Task recorder helps users write
test cases that represent a business process task or business process.
It focuses on high-responsiveness, a flexible extensibility application programming interface (API), and seamless integrations with consumers of business process recordings.</p>
<p>The Task recorder is integrated with the Lifecycle Services
business process modeler (BPM) tool so that users can produce business
process diagrams from recordings to design their applications. Additionally, the Task recorder can auto-generate application verification tests and play back previously-recorded processes.</p>
<p>The Task recorder records the user actions including button selections, value entry, and navigation.</p>
<p>To see how to create and consume a Task recording as a developer for testing, watch this video.</p>
<div class="embeddedvideo"><iframe allowfullscreen="true" data-linktype="external" frameborder="0" src="https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=37dfbb87-3f6a-4bea-bf11-7e0f55e595a4"></iframe></div>
<p>To create a task recording, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>We recommend that you refresh the browser before each new recording
to create a new user session. Refreshing your browser will restart
the Task recorder if you already have it open. This will provide the
most stable recording experience and prevent unwanted changes to an
existing task recording.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Settings &gt; Task recorder</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Create recording</strong>.</li>
<li>Enter a name of the recording and select <strong>Start</strong>. The Task recorder immediately enters Recording mode. The pane will display information and controls that are related to the process of recording.</li>
<li>Run through a process. As you go through forms, select buttons, and enter data, steps are added to the task recording.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can download and save a task recording in different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Task recording package</strong> - This can be used to play a task guide,
maintain the recording, or edit the recording's annotation.</li>
<li><strong>Raw recording file</strong> - This is used for developer scenarios, such
as test code generation.</li>
<li><strong>BPM file</strong> - This creates a Word document with the recorded steps,
as well as any screenshots that were captured.</li>
<li><strong>Save the recording to the Lifecycle Services library</strong> - If the Lifecycle Services library is
set as a Help library, you will be able to find the task guide by
searching the <strong>Help</strong> menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Task recorder can automatically run steps of an existing
recording. You can also use Maintenance mode to update an existing
recording with additional or adjusted steps. When Maintenance mode is
complete, a new recording is produced that contains the original steps and the new steps. Keep in mind that any steps that are not run during
maintenance are not included in the new recording.</p>
<p>To maintain a recording that you have saved locally as a file with the ".axtr" extension,
follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <strong>Task recorder</strong> pane.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Maintain a recording</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>It is in a file I can upload</strong> to load the Task recorder package (.axtr).</li>
<li>Select <strong>Start</strong>. The Task recorder begins recording in Maintenance  mode.</li>
</ol>
<p>While in Maintenance mode, you can choose from several controls to
maintain a task recording:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step</strong> - Run the next step. Any open lookups, drop dialogs,   or Action Pane tabs might be dismissed when you use <strong>Step</strong>. In  situations where open lookups, drop dialogs, or Action   Pane tabs are being used, choose the <strong>Play</strong> option instead.</li>
<li><strong>Play</strong> - Run the remaining steps sequentially until playback  is paused. While you are playing the recording, the <strong>Play</strong> button will become a <strong>Pause</strong> button to pause the playback. If a step cannot be performed, it will be skipped and automatically paused.</li>
<li><strong>Play until</strong> - This works like the <strong>Play</strong> option, but you can select the step that the playback will stop at.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional features are available for you to edit the recording that simplifies the maintenance process.
If you open <strong>Settings &gt; Task Recorder &gt; Edit recording</strong>, you can insert steps without re-recording the entire file, move steps without re-recording the entire file, and collapse the recording name and description fields to view more steps.</p>
<p>To edit a recording, use the following procedures.</p>
<h2 id="insert-step">Insert step</h2>
<ol>
<li>Select the step after which you want the new step to be inserted.</li>
<li>Go to the page that you need to record, and the <strong>Insert step</strong> option will appear.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Insert Step</strong>. The Task recorder will switch to Record mode.</li>
<li>Perform the step.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Stop</strong>. You can repeat this step as needed.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Done editing</strong>.</li>
<li>Save or publish the task recording.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="move-steps-under-a-sub-task">Move steps under a sub task</h2>
<ol>
<li>Select the step after which you want to move.</li>

<h2 id="import-a-task-recorder-recording-into-visual-studio">Import a Task Recorder recording into Visual Studio</h2>
<p>You can import a Task Recorder recording into Visual Studio to generate
test code. The task recording will be imported as an XML file, and the
test code is generated from it by using 
FormAdaptors
.</p>
<p>To import a task recording into Visual Studio, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Record a scenario by using <strong>Task Recorder</strong>.</li>
<li>In Visual Studio, select the <strong>Dynamics 365</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Add-ins &gt; Import Task Recording</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the module that you want to import the task recording to.</li>
<li>Select the XML file for the recording.</li>
<li>Test code will be generated based on the <strong>SysTestAdapter</strong> and
<strong>FormAdaptor</strong>. (This code can be viewed in the Visual Studio IDE.)</li>
<li>Set up Visual Studio options for test discovery and implementation.</li>
<li>From the menu options, select <strong>Test &gt; Windows &gt; Test Explorer</strong>.
Tests from test code will be available for you to select from.</li>
<li>Select the test and select <strong>Run &gt; Execute selected</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Task recorder feature includes additional advanced recording options. One option is the advance grid row selection. To ensure that the
correct grid row is selected during test playback, the filter criteria
needs to be explicitly defined. While you are recording, after you have opened a form that contains a grid and have selected a record, the Task recorder grid row selection dialog will appear. The dialog will have a filter pane pre-populated with the Task recorder's best guess. You can manually define the filter or use the best guess and apply the filter to the recording.</p>
<p>The Task recorder's <strong>Rollback changes to business data</strong> option can
revert business data that is created during recording when recording is
complete. This option can be used primarily to create task recordings for
tests. The rollback option only affects records that are created during the recording session. This is only available on non-production environments where the Test tools have been installed.</p>
<p>You can play the task guide <strong>On-rails</strong>. Users can play the task guide
to be prompted about what step to complete next. When the step is
completed, the task guide will automatically progress to the next step.
These <em>rails</em> prevent the user from selecting elements other than the
element that is identified in the task guide.</p>
<p>Additionally, if the task guide finds that a necessary element for the
step is not visible or not on the form on the user interface, an error
state occurs. A message will prompt describing the issue. The user can
then find the element and continue with the task guide. If you use the <strong>Next step</strong> and <strong>Previous step</strong> options to move through the task guide, you can sometimes prompt an error state if the previous or next step refers to an element that is not on the current form. You can also use the <strong>See more</strong> button to expand the task guide to see additional information, such as an example value or a note.</p>

<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>Best practices can be used to keep X++ code clean and uniform so that future developers can easily read the code to see what customizations have been done. Additionally, best practices can help keep code in
line for future upgrades to alleviate issues. To enable a best practice
check, you can go to <strong>Visual Studio &gt; Extensions &gt; Dynamics 365 &gt; Options &gt; Best
Practices</strong> and view the best practices for each model. You can also
turn off best practices for specific models on the <strong>Best
Practices</strong> page.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of the Visual studio best practices page." data-linktype="relative-path" src="./rawmb500/media_best_practices.png"/></p>
<p>The best practice check is run during the build. In the <strong>Results</strong> window,
you can see all the best practice issues and the location of each issue. You can also run the best practice check from the command prompt. You can run best practices for all forms, specific elements, all items in a model, and items in all models and then write the output to a log file. The following list shows some code snippets for how to run best practices against different elements in the command prompt.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Run best practice on all forms in a module</strong> - 
xppbp     -module:FleetManagement form:*
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Run best practice on specific elements</strong> - 
xppbp  -module:FleetManagement class:MyClass form:MyForm
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Run best practice on all items in the model (and only for this one model in the module)</strong> - 
xppbp -module:FleetManagement -model:FleetManagement -all
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Run best practice on all items in all models in the module</strong> - 
xppbp -module:FleetManagement -all
</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Write the best practice output to log files</strong> - 
xppbp -module:FleetManagement -all -xmllog=Log.xml -log=Log.txt
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can suppress best practice checks for each model. To do this, you
can right-click your project and select <strong>Edit best practice
suppressions</strong>. This will open an XML file where you can suppress best
practices. You will need to add the model that you want to suppress by using the tags 
DiagnosticType
, 
Severity
, 
Path
, 
Moniker
, and 
Justification
. You should be able to copy the information
from the model's BuildModelResult.xml that is created during the build
into the <strong>Edit Best Practice Suppressions XML</strong> file. The justification
message might need to be modified to be more meaningful.</p>

<h1 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">Identify various categories and types of errors</h1>
<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>Error statements are developed before testing to dictate what should be
displayed when a test passes or fails. You can handle errors by using the

Throw
, 
Try...catch
, 
Finally
, and 
Retry
 statements to handle exceptions. An exception is a regulated jump away from the code run.</p>
<p>The 
throw
 keyword is used to throw an exception enum
value. For example, the statement 
throw Exception::error;

would be used to throw an error exception. We recommend that you use the

Global::error
 method instead of the 
Exception::error
. The 
Global::error
 can write a message to the Infolog when an error exception is thrown and convert a label automatically into text. You can also write the 
Global::error("Error message.")
 as 
error("Error message.")
.</p>
<p>The 
try...catch
 keywords are used to process a thrown
exception through the catch. The code is run in the 
try
 code block.
If an error is thrown, the code will jump to run the catch code blocks
sequentially to see if the thrown error is specified to handle the
error. It is a common practice to have the first catch statement handle
the 
Exception::Error
 enum value and leave one catch blank
to catch any unspecified error. The 
Finally
 keyword can be
used with the 
Try...catch
 statement. The code in the

finally
 code block will run when the code leaves the 
try
 block
either normally or because of an error. See the following code example.</p>
<pre>
try
{
  // Code here.
}
catch (Exception::Numeric)
{
  info("Caught a Numeric exception.");
}
catch
{
  info("Caught an exception.");
}
finally
{
  // Executed no matter how the try block exits.
}
</pre>
<p>The 
retry
 keyword can only be written in a

catch
 block. This causes the code to jump back to the
first line in the 
try
 code block. A 
retry

should be used when the issue can be fixed through code. The

retry
 gives the code an additional chance to succeed and
will display an Infolog when the 
try
 block started to run. You must
make sure that the 
retry
 statement does not cause an infinite
loop. We recommend that you include a variable in the 
try

block to test if you are in an infinite loop.</p>
<p>You can throw several error exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Break</strong> - The user pressed Break or Ctrl + C.</li>
<li><strong>CLRError</strong> - The error occurred while the CLR functionality was
being used.</li>
<li><strong>CodeAccessSecurity</strong> - An error occurred while the

CodeAccessPermission.demand
 method was being used.</li>
<li><strong>DDEerror</strong> - An error occurred while the DDE system class was
being used.</li>
<li><strong>Deadlock</strong> - A database deadlock occurred because several
transactions are waiting for each other.</li>
<li><strong>DuplicateKeyException</strong> - An error occurred in a transaction that
is using Optimistic Concurrency Control. The transaction can be
retried.</li>
<li><strong>DuplicateKeyExceptionNotRecovered</strong> - An error occurred in a
transaction that is using Optimistic Concurrency Control. The code
won't be retried, and this exception cannot be caught
in a transaction.</li>
<li><strong>Error</strong> - A fatal error occurred. The transaction has been
stopped.</li>
<li><strong>Internal</strong> - An internal error occurred in the development
system.</li>
<li><strong>Numeric</strong> - An error occurred when the 
str2int
,

str2int64
, or 
str2num
 function was used.</li>
<li><strong>UpdateConflict</strong> - An error occurred in a transaction during an
update.</li>
<li><strong>UpdateConflictNotRecovered</strong> - An error occurred in a transaction
during an update. This exception cannot be retried.</li>
<li><strong>TransientSQLConnectionError</strong> - An error occurred during the
query run. The transaction will be canceled. This exception
will not be caught within a transaction.</li>

<h1 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">Configure the testing environment and prepare data</h1>
<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>Accurate data is key to measuring the success of code. You will need to
set up the test environment and prepare data to be tested in Visual
Studio. You will also need to deploy a testing environment for users to
test customization to code. A testing environment should be a Tier-1
environment to perform unit tests in. To learn more about deploying an
environment, review the <a data-linktype="absolute-path" href="/en-us/training/modules/explore-technical-architecture-finance-operations/?azure-portal=true">Explore the technical architecture of finance and operations apps</a> module.</p>
<p>To prepare the test environment with proper data, you can use the <strong>Data management</strong> workspace (<strong>System administration &gt; Data management</strong>).</p>
<p><a data-linktype="relative-path" href="media/data-management.png#lightbox"> <img alt="Screenshot of the data management workspace." data-linktype="relative-path" src="./rawmb500/media_data_management.png"/> </a></p>
<p>The data management tool uses data entities that represent the data of
one or more tables. You can create a data project to import data into
one or more entities. The data that is pushed into the entity will be pushed to the main table of finance and operations apps. You can import data through multiple file types, including .csv, .xlsx, .txt, or a package. A
package holds several data import files with metadata to specify the
sequence in which the import files are inserted into the system.</p>
<p>You can also use Lifecycle Services with the data management framework to
import the configurations and data between environments.</p>

<h1 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">Run unit tests</h1>
<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>Large projects can have multiple developers who are creating code in their own environments. Before pushing code changes to production, unit tests should be performed to verify the code. Unit tests must follow specific syntax. The class must extend the 
SysTestCase
 class. Test
methods must be public, cannot have parameters, must return void, and
need to be decorated with the 
SysTestMethod
.</p>
<p>The test method can include other methods that do not follow
these rules. Test methods typically have three distinct methods:
arrange, act, and assert. The arrange method sets up all the variables.
The act method does some processing. The assert method verifies if the
result is expected. You can use the 
setup()
 method that is
built into the framework to arrange the variables that will be used throughout the test methods. For example, if you have a variable

currencyAmt
 that is used in multiple test methods, instead
of creating a variable for 
currencyAmt
 in each test
method, you would only need to create it in the 
setup()

method.</p>
<p>You can choose from several different assert methods to verify the
test. 
AssertEquals()
 is the most common, but other methods are available, such as 
assertTrue()
 and 
assertNotNull()
. You can also use the code 
this.parmExceptionExpected(true)
 to assert that an error
thrown is the correct behavior.</p>
<p>After the test class is created, you can right-click the class and
select <strong>Run tests</strong>. This selection will open the unit test toolbar. Using unit tests can be a fast and reliable way to develop code. Over time, you will build new tests as new functionality is added. This allows you to quickly run these unit tests to make sure that everything works as expected.

<p>Visual Studio comes with a debugger that examines code as it is
run. Debuggers are often used by developers to catch errors in
code. When debugging, you can see value pulls, queries that are
called, and a call stack of all the classes and methods that have been
run. You can also watch specific variables to track the value. In
addition to identifying errors, you can use the debugger to better
understand how the code manipulates variable values and the order in which certain processes are run. This can help you gain a better understanding of certain processes, like seeing what validations are made during item entry.</p>
<p>To use the Visual Studio debugger, you will need to set break points and
a startup object in your project. A breakpoint is a designation in the
code where the code implementation will stop when running in the debugger. A breakpoint is represented as a red dot by the line number of the code. You can set as many breakpoints as needed, but excessive breakpoints can make debugging take a long time due to the code constantly starting and stopping. The debugger toolbar contains options where you can set breakpoints, remove breakpoints, and remove all breakpoints.</p>
<p><a data-linktype="relative-path" href="media/add-break-point.png#lightbox"> <img alt="Animation showing how to add a break point." data-linktype="relative-path" src="./rawmb500/media_add_break_point.png"/></a></p>
<p>When the code comes to a break point, you can also select options in the
debugger toolbar to <strong>Step Into</strong> the code line by line. Doing so will
also go into any method calls in the code. You can <strong>Step Over</strong> to
proceed to the next line without going into any method calls. You can
also <strong>Step Out</strong>, which will run the current function to completion.
With the <strong>Run</strong> button, you can continue running the implementation until completion or until the code comes to another breakpoint. The debugger tool also has a <strong>Stop</strong> tool to end the running code and exit the debugger mode.</p>
<p>The startup object is needed to tell what class to run when you start
the debugger. You can select the startup object by right-clicking an
object in your project and then selecting <strong>Set as Startup Object</strong>.
Usually, this is a form or class. When you decide to run the debugger for
the object, from the <strong>Debug</strong> menu, select <strong>Start</strong> and a new window will open, running the startup object that you have selected.</p>

<p>Testing and validating processes is crucial to
the success of your implementation. Often, challenges occur with
acquiring the resources, time, or proper data that is needed to test new
customizations. Using the test framework to create unit tests can help
automate repeatable testing. If new customizations are created, these
tests can be rerun to ensure that all functionality is maintained.</p>
<p>The test framework can be used with the Task recorder to create tests
based on the task guide that is recorded. Additionally, you can use these task guides to follow the correct processes.</p>
<p>Other tools in finance and operations apps can help ensure that code is
written with best practices. Using best practices can help ensure that
your code is following Microsoft's guidelines and is more future proof
to future releases that might make some functionality obsolete.</p>
<p>As errors occur, you can use the exception handling to handle various
errors, allow for graceful error correction, and provide a message to
users on what an error is and how to resolve it. The debugger can be used
to examine the code to see exactly what the code is doing and what
data is being used. Finance and operations apps provides several tools for you to test processes and handle errors.</p>

<p>This unit introduces the capabilities of the various reporting tools in finance and operations apps and when to use them.</p>
<p>The five reporting experiences are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Operational views</strong> - Show specific data that is needed for the
organization. This includes creating reports that can be customized
to show analytical data and transactional views.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Business documents</strong> - Reports that are used to capture and exchange processed business data. This includes regulatory documents and
documents that capture business transactions, such as sales
invoices.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Analytical tools and visualizations</strong> - Present the data in a way
that allows users to manipulate and explore their data. Creating a view of customer sales for each quarter could be an example of an analytical report.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Electronic reporting</strong> - Can be used to configure formats for
electronic documents. This tool is used often with tax reporting,
electronic invoicing, or any report that would need to be sent
electronically.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Financial reporting</strong> - Provides in-depth accounting management
tools based on financial activity across a company. Financial
reporting includes documents such as balance sheets and cash flow.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the reporting tools address different reporting needs, you
must determine when each reporting tool should be used.</p>
<p>Use an operational view if you need a report that is intended for the organization to monitor data and transactions. If the report does not need to be shared or printed, and if data should be near real time.</p>
<p>You should use a business document when you need a report for the back office to show real-time transactional data. The data needs to be distributed as a file through email or printers. If you need to let users create their own views to
explore near real-time data quickly by using dashboards, tiles, and
visualizations, you should consider using analytical tools and
visualizations such as Power BI.</p>
<p>Electronic reporting should be used if the user needs to be able to create real-time reports on transactional data that allow electronic transfer and use Microsoft Excel export capabilities. The financial reporting tool should be considered when accounting reports need to be created for financial officers, and the reports need printing and Excel export capabilities.</p>

<h1 class="margin-right-xxl-desktop" id="module-unit-title">Create and modify report data sources and supporting classes</h1>
<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>Reports use data sources to pull data. SQL Server Reporting Services
(SSRS) and Power BI are two reporting tools that use data sources. This unit covers the creation and modification of data sources for these reporting tools.</p>
<p>SSRS uses data sets that are defined by a data source. You can assign a data source to an SSRS report through Visual Studio.</p>
<p><img alt="Diagram of Data sources that can be assigned to an S S R S report." data-linktype="relative-path" src="./rawmb500/media_data_sources.png"/></p>
<p>In the report parameters, you can select the data source for the data set and the data source type. The data source type can be the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Query</strong> - A query data source type uses an existing query or a new query.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Business logic</strong> – Use this type to get a data source other than finance and operations apps.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Report data provider class</strong> – You can use this type when a query cannot be used alone. In this case, additional logic is needed to run the report. Along with the RDP class, a contract class is also needed to define the report parameters.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Enum provider</strong> – An AX enum provider can be used when the report parameter is an Enum type to filter the report view.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need to modify a data source, you will
need to extend the tables or RDP classes to make modifications.</p>
<p>Power BI can connect to data sources, ranging from files, databases,
other Power BI datasets and data flows, Azure databases, online
services, and even web URLs.</p>
<p><img alt="Diagram of the data sources that Power B I can connect to." data-linktype="relative-path" src="./rawmb500/media_power_bi_data.png"/></p>
<p>Use the following procedure to connect to a
data source to create a Power BI report.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In the Power BI toolbar, select the <strong>Get Data</strong> button. The most
common data sources are displayed, but you can select more to get
access to the entire list.</p>
</li>
<li><p>After you have selected the data source, select <strong>Connect</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A connection window is displayed where you can specify the data
connection and enter any required credentials. Select <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <strong>Navigator</strong> page will appear. You can either select the <strong>Load</strong> button to load all the data, or you can select <strong>Edit</strong> to modify the query.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When you have completed these steps, Power BI will be connected to a data source that you can use to create reports and data visualizations.</p>

<div hidden="" id="module-unit-notification-container"></div>
<p>Finance and operations apps have several ways to restrict user access to
reports. Authorization is used to grant access to elements of the
program through security permissions. Security permissions are combined
into privileges, which are then combined into duties. Permissions,
privileges, and duties can be added to a role and assigned to a user.
You can use this role-based security to grant user access to reports that are based on roles.</p>
<p>You can view security roles that are assigned to users from the <strong>Security configuration</strong> page in finance and operations apps. By
selecting a role on this page, you can view the duties, privileges, and
permissions that are related to the role. You can access the Security configuration page by going to <strong>System administration &gt; Security &gt; Security configuration</strong></p>
<p><a data-linktype="relative-path" href="media/security-1.svg#lightbox"><img alt="Screenshot of the Security configuration page." data-linktype="relative-path" src="./rawmb500/media_security_1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Data security is used to deny user access to tables,
fields, and rows in the database. Data security uses the extensible data
security framework (XDS) to control access to transactional data by
assigning data security policies to security roles. These policies can
restrict access to data, based on either the effective date or user
data. We recommend that you use the extensible data security to help secure data.</p>
<p>In addition to these security options, the Table Permissions Framework
can help protect data and is enforced by the Application Object Server (AOS). The Table Permissions Framework allows you to grant or deny Create, Read, Update, or Delete (CRUD) permissions to the data in a table. You can use this to give certain roles access to view and manipulate certain datasets.</p>
<p>For instance, you might want a salesperson to be able to view
and update a customer, but might want to deny them access to create
new customers or delete existing customers. To do this, you need to
grant the Read and Update permissions and deny Create and Delete
permissions for that role on the customer table.</p>
<h2 id="table-permissions-framework-example">Table permissions framework example</h2>
<p>Table Permissions Framework adds table-level security that verifies user
rights regardless of the request origin. For example, consider
the following scenario:</p>
<ol>
<li>ABC Corporation implemented finance and operations apps. Users can access data within the application.</li>
<li>The administrator configured a security role named Management.
Members of this role have access to sensitive financial data. One of
the tables that stores the sensitive financial data is named
ManagerFinancialData. Previously, this table was added as part of a
customization for the application.</li>
<li>The administrator configures the ManagerFinancialData table so that
AOS must authorize all operations for that table.</li>
<li>Before allowing Read access to data in the ManagerFinancialData
table, AOS will verify that the user is a member of the
Management role and that members of that role have permissions to
read the data. If the user is not a member of the Management role,
AOS will deny the read operation.</li>
</ol>

<p>After an SSRS report is created, it must be deployed before you can
access it in finance and operations apps. You can deploy reports from the
PowerShell or from Visual Studio. Deploying reports from PowerShell
can be useful if you need to deploy a report in an environment that does
not have access to Visual Studio. However, you should not do this in a
Production environment.</p>
<p>You can deploy either all reports or a specific report from the
PowerShell. To deploy all reports, open the PowerShell as an
administrator and run the following command:</p>
<pre>
*C:\AosService\PackagesLocalDirectory\Plugins\AxReportVmRoleStartupTask\DeployAllReportsToSSRS.ps1 -PackageInstallLocation \"C:\AosService\PackagesLocalDirectory\" *
</pre>
<p>Depending on the environment that you are using, the drive might vary. Generally, the drive is C:\, L:\, or K:\.</p>
<p>To run a specific report, you need the report name. Though you will open
the PowerShell as an administrator, you will run the following command line instead:</p>
<pre>
*C:\AosService\PackagesLocalDirectory\Plugins\AxReportVmRoleStartupTask\DeployAllReportsToSSRS.ps1 -Module ApplicationSuite -ReportName TaxVatRegister.Report*
</pre>
<p>To deploy a report from Visual Studio, you will need to add the report
to your project. Right-click the report and select the <strong>Deploy</strong>
option.</p>

<p>Understanding the types of reporting tools and which reports should be
used is important to creating meaningful reports for your organization.
While you might have the correct report type, you will need to make sure that you have the correct data. Creating and modifying data sources let you get the correct data. By using the security features, you can grant access and restrict access that users might have to certain reports and data.</p>
<p>When the report is finished and security is created for the report, you
can deploy the report to finance and operations apps by using PowerShell or
Visual Studio.</p>
